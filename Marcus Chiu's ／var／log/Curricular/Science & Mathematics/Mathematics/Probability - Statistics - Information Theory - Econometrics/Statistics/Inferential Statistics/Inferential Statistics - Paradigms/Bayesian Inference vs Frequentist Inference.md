# Example [[Point／Parameter Estimation／Estimator／Estimate／Approximation - Estimating Parameters of Parametric Distribution／Population Function／Model (Population Parameters - Sample Statistics)|Parameter Estimation]] (Frequentist vs Bayesian)

say we want to estimate the average height of adult females. assume that:
- height has a [[Univariate Normal／Gaussian／Gauss／Laplace-Gauss﻿ Distribution／Model／Process (Bell Curve)|normal distribution]]
- [[Univariate Analysis Descriptive Statistics|standard deviation]] is available and we don’t need to estimate it

Therefore, the only thing we need to estimate is the [mean of the normal distribution](https://www.probabilisticworld.com/mean-variance-probability-distributions/)

      "frequentist reasoning\n> I don’t know what the mean female height is. However, I know that its value is fixed (not a random one). Therefore, I cannot assign probabilities to the mean being equal to a certain value, or being less than/greater than some other value. The most I can do is collect data from a sample of the population and estimate its mean as the value which is most consistent with the data.\n\nThe value mentioned in the end is known as the [[Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)|maximum likelihood estimate]]. It depends on the distribution of the data and I won’t go into details on its calculation. However, for normally distributed data, it’s quite straightforward: the maximum likelihood estimate of the population mean is equal to the sample mean",
      "bayesian reasoning\n> I agree that the mean is a fixed and unknown value, but I see no problem in representing the uncertainty probabilistically. I will do so by defining a probability distribution over the possible values of the mean and use sample data to update this distribution.\n\nIn a Bayesian setting, the newly collected data makes the probability distribution over the parameter narrower. More specifically, narrower around the parameter’s true (unknown) value. You do the updating process by applying [[Bayes' Rule／Theorem／Law (Prior - Posterior - Distribution - Likelihood - Probability of Evidence)|Bayes' theorem]]\n\nThe way to update the entire probability distribution is by applying Bayes’ theorem to each possible value of the parameter"

Frequentists’ main objection to the Bayesian approach is the use of prior probabilities. Their criticism is that there is always a subjective element in assigning them. Paradoxically, Bayesians consider not using prior probabilities one of the biggest weaknesses of the frequentist approach
