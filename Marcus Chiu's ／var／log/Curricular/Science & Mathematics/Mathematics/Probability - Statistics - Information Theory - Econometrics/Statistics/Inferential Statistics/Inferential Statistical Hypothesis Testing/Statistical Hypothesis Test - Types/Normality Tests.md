###### Normality Tests
````excerpt
- is a range of techniques that you can use to check if your data sample deviates from a [[Univariate Normal／Gaussian／Gauss／Laplace-Gauss﻿ Distribution／Model／Process (Bell Curve)|Gaussian distribution]]
- An important decision point when working with a sample of data is whether to use [[(Parametric vs Non-Parametric) Statistical Methods／Procedures|parametric or nonparametric statistical methods]]:
	- parametric statistical methods assume that the data has a known and specific distribution, often a Gaussian distribution
	- non-parametric statistical methods do not require data to be Gaussian
