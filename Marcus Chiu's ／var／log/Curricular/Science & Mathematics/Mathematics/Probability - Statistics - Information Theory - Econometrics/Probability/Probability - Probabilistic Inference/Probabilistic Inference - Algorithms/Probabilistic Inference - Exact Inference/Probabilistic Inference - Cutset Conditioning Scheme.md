<strong>Cutset Conditioning Scheme</strong>
- is an extension of [[Probabilistic Inference - Exact Inference|exact inference algorithm]]
- is based on the fact, that observing the value of certain variables can simplify the variable elimination process
- idea: when a variable is not observed, we can enumerate all of its possible values, then for each value perform an exact inference algorithm of your choice (e.g. [[Probabilistic Inference - Bucket Elimination (BE) - Variable Elimination (VE)|Variable Elimination]]), and then sum the results
- the cutset is the set of unobserved variables we are conditioning on
- in terms of number of operations, the conditioning algorithm offers no benefit over the [[Probabilistic Inference - Bucket Elimination (BE) - Variable Elimination (VE)|variable elimination algorithm]]. However, it offers a continuum of time-space trade-offs, which can be extremely important in cases where the factors created by variable elimination are too big to fit in main memory

# Cutset Conditioning - Problems
- if the cutset consists of 𝑤 nodes each with 𝑑 states, then we would need to run the [[Probabilistic Inference - Exact Inference|exact inference algorithm]]𝑑<sup>𝑤</sup> times
- to combine the result of the many possible instantiations of the cutset we need to find priors to each one
