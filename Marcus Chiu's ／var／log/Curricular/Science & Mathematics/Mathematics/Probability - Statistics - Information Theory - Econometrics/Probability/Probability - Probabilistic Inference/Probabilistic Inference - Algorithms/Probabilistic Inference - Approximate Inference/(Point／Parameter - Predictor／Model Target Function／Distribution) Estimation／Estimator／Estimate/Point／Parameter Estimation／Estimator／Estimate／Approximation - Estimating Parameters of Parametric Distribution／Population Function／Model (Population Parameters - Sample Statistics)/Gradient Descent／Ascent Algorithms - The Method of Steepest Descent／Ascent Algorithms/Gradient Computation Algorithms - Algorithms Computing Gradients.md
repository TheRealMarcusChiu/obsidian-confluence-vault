# Gradient Computation - Types Comparisons
- Symbolic Differentiation faces the difficulty of converting a computer program into a single mathematical expression and can lead to inefficient code
- Numerical differentiation (the method of finite differences) can introduce round-off errors in the discretization process and cancellation

Both symbolic and numerical differentiation:
- have problems with calculating higher derivatives, where complexity and errors increase
- are slow at computing partial derivatives of a function with respect to many inputs, as is needed for gradient-based optimization algorithms

Automatic differentiation solves all of these problems.
# Gradient Computation - Other Types
- <strong>[[Batch Gradient Estimation - Stochastic Gradient Estimation - Mini-Batch Gradient Estimation|Batch Gradient Estimation]]</strong> - approximates the true gradients using the <strong>ENTIRE</strong> training set
- <strong>[[Batch Gradient Estimation - Stochastic Gradient Estimation - Mini-Batch Gradient Estimation|Stochastic Gradient Estimation]]</strong> - approximates the true gradients using a <strong>SINGLE</strong> element of the training set
- <strong>[[Batch Gradient Estimation - Stochastic Gradient Estimation - Mini-Batch Gradient Estimation|Mini-Batch Gradient Estimation]]</strong> - approximates the true gradients using a <strong>SUBSET</strong> of the training set
- <strong>Hessian Matrix Approximation</strong> - the [[Hessian／Hesse Matrix|Hessian matrix]] contains second-order derivatives and provides additional information about the curvature of the loss function. Techniques like finite differences, the Gauss-Newton method, or the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm can be used to approximate the Hessian matrix and compute gradients more accurately.
