# Simple Sampling - Generalized

assume:
- function ℎ(𝑋)
- 𝑋 has a probability distribution 𝐏
- it is easy to generate a sample 𝑥<sub>𝑖</sub> from probability distribution 𝐏
- computation of ℎ(𝑥<sub>𝑖</sub>) is easy

we want to compute the expected value of ℎ(𝑋) (i.e. 𝐄<sub>𝐏</sub>\[ℎ(𝑋)\])
- 𝐄<sub>𝐏</sub>\[ℎ(𝑋)\] = ∫ℎ(𝑥)𝐏(𝑥)𝑑𝑥 <font style="color: rgb(128,128,128);">\# continuous case</font>
- 𝐄<sub>𝐏</sub>\[ℎ(𝑋)\] = 𝛴<sub>𝑥∊𝑋</sub> ℎ(𝑥)𝐏(𝑥) <font style="color: rgb(128,128,128);">\# discrete case</font>

is estimated with:
- 𝐄<sub>𝐏</sub>\[ℎ(𝑋)\] ≈ (1/𝑛) 𝛴<sub>1≤𝑖≤𝑛</sub>ℎ(𝑥<sub>𝑖</sub>)

where:
- ℎ(𝑥) - is some [[Functions (Domain - Codomain - Preimage - Image - Range)|function]]
- 𝐏 - is the [[Probability - Distributions|probability distribution]]
- 𝐄<sub>𝐏</sub>\[..\] - expected value based on 𝐏
- 𝑛 - is the number of samples generated
- {𝑥<sub>1</sub>, ..., 𝑥<sub>𝑖</sub>, ..., 𝑥<sub>𝑛</sub>} - are samples [[Independent and Identically Distributed (IID)|i.i.d.]] generated from 𝐏

> - [[Variance - Standard Deviation (RMS Deviation from Average)|standard deviation]] = √\[𝑛<em>𝑝</em>(1−<em>𝑝</em>)\]

> therefore, we obtain:
> - 𝐄\[𝑝̂\] = (1/𝑛) (number of 𝑋<sub>1</sub>, ..., 𝑋<sub>𝑛</sub>∈ 𝐴)
> - 𝐄\[𝑝̂\] = (1/𝑛) \[𝐄(𝑋<sub>1</sub>) +  ... + 𝐄(𝑋<sub>𝑛</sub>)\]
> - 𝐄\[𝑝̂\] = (1/𝑛) \[𝑝 +  ... + 𝑝\]
> - 𝐄\[𝑝̂\] = (1/𝑛) 𝑛𝑝
> - 𝐄\[𝑝̂\] = 𝑝
>
> - 𝐒𝐭𝐝(𝑝̂) = (1/𝑛) (number of 𝑋<sub>1</sub>, ..., 𝑋<sub>𝑛</sub>∈ 𝐴)
> - 𝐒𝐭𝐝(𝑝̂) = (1/𝑛) √\[𝑛<em>𝑝</em>(1−<em>𝑝</em>)\]
> - 𝐒𝐭𝐝(𝑝̂) = √\[<em>𝑝</em>(1−<em>𝑝</em>) / 𝑛\]
>
> thus, we can conclude the following:
> - 𝐄\[𝑝̂\] = 𝑝, shows that our Monte Carlo Estimator of <em>𝑝</em> is unbiased, so that over a long run, it will on the average return the desired quantity <em>𝑝</em>
> - 𝐒𝐭𝐝(𝑝̂) = √\[<em>𝑝</em>(1−<em>𝑝</em>) / 𝑛\], indicates that the standard deviation of our estimator 𝑝̂ decreases with 𝑛 at the rate of 1/√𝑛 . Larger Monte Carlo experiments produce more accurate results. A 100-fold increase in the number of generated variables reduces the standard deviation (therefore, enhancing accuracy) by a factor of 10
