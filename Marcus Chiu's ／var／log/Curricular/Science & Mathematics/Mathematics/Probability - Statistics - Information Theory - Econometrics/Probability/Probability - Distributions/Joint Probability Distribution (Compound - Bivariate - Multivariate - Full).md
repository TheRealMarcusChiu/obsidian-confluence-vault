    <strong>[[Joint Probability Distribution (Compound - Bivariate - Multivariate - Full)|joint probability distribution]]</strong> <strong>(compound probability distribution</strong>) - refers to the probability distribution of 2 or more random variables occurring together
    - <strong>multivariate joint probability distribution</strong> - sample space is a [[Bivariate／Multivariate Analysis Descriptive Statistics|multivariate]] random variable (2 or more dimensions/variables) (e.g. the probability of 𝐴 and 𝐵 and 𝐶, denoted 𝐏(𝐴,𝐵,𝐶))
    	- <strong>bivariate joint probability distribution</strong> - sample space is a [[Bivariate／Multivariate Analysis Descriptive Statistics|bivariate]] random variable (two-dimensional variables) (e.g. the probability of 𝐴 and 𝐵, denoted 𝐏(𝐴,𝐵))
    - <strong>full joint probability distribution</strong> - refers to a probability distribution of all random variables in a given domain
