# Definition

on each trial, the choice of which probability distribution generates the sample is determined by sampling a distribution identity from a [[Mixture／Mixed／Multi Model Probability Distribution|multinoulli distribution]]
- 𝐏(𝑥) = 𝛴<sub>𝑖</sub>𝐏(𝑐=𝑖)𝐏(𝑥|𝑐=𝑖)

where:
- 𝐏(𝑐) - is the [[Mixture／Mixed／Multi Model Probability Distribution|multinoulli distribution]] over distribution identities

# Example

a mixed distribution modeled with 3 [[Univariate Normal／Gaussian／Gauss／Laplace-Gauss﻿ Distribution／Model／Process (Bell Curve)|normal distributions]]
