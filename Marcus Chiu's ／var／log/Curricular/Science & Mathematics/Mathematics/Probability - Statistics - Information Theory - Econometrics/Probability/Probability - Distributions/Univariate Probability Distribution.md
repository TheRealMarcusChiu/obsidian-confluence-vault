````excerpt
<strong>[[Univariate Probability Distribution|univariate probability distribution]]</strong> (sometimes just called<strong> probability distribution</strong>)
- is a model that describes the probability of a random variable
- is essentially a "list" of all possible outcomes (of the random variable) along with their corresponding [[Probability|probability]] value
- a variety of phenomena can be described by relatively few families of probability distribution models

# UPD - Modeling a Random Variable (Discrete or Continuous)

The univariate probability distribution of a random variable is either discrete or continuous:
