###### Continuous Probability Distributions
````excerpt
- used in scenarios where the set of possible outcomes is <strong>continuous</strong> (e.g. temperature on a given day)
- ranges include:
	- [[Real Intervals (Empty／Degenerate／Proper／Bounded／Finite／Half-Bounded／Unbounded／Left／Right／Open／Closed Intervals)|bounded intervals]] (a, b)
	- [[Real Intervals (Empty／Degenerate／Proper／Bounded／Finite／Half-Bounded／Unbounded／Left／Right／Open／Closed Intervals)|unbounded intervals]] such as (a, +∞), (−∞, b), or (−∞, +∞)
	- combinations of several such intervals
- the probability of any individual outcome equals zero (it's possible, it's just probability zero)

^excerpt

For all continuous variables, the [[Probability Distribution - Discrete Functions／Models (Probability Mass Functions)|probability mass function]] 𝑃𝑀𝐹(𝑥) is always equal to zero

𝑃𝑀𝐹(𝑥) = 𝐏(𝑋=𝑥) = 0 for all 𝑥

As a result, the 𝑃𝑀𝐹(𝑥) does not carry any information about a random variable 𝑋. Rather, we can use the [[Probability Distribution Function Variants - Probability／Mass／Density／Cumulative／Survivor／Hazard／Cumulative-Hazard／Inverse／Moment-Generating Distribution Functions|cumulative distribution function]] 𝐶𝐷𝐹(𝑥)
- 𝐶𝐷𝐹(𝑥) = 𝐏(𝑋≤𝑥)
- 𝐶𝐷𝐹(𝑥) = 𝐏(𝑋\<𝑥) + 𝐏(𝑋=𝑥)
- 𝐶𝐷𝐹(𝑥) = 𝐏(𝑋\<𝑥) + 0
- 𝐶𝐷𝐹(𝑥) = 𝐏(𝑋\<𝑥)

the derivative of a continuous 𝐶𝐷𝐹(𝑥) is a [[Probability Distribution - Continuous Functions／Models (Probability Density Functions)|probability density function]] 𝑃𝐷𝐹(𝑥)
