<strong>Z-Distribution (Standard Normal Distribution)</strong> is a [[Univariate Normal／Gaussian／Gauss／Laplace-Gauss﻿ Distribution／Model／Process (Bell Curve)|Normal Distribution]] with “standard parameters”:
- 𝜇 = 0
- 𝜎 = 1

therefore, the normal distribution
- 𝑓(𝑋=𝑥) = (1/\[𝜎\*𝑠𝑞𝑟𝑡(2𝜋)\]) 𝑒<sup>-(𝑥-𝜇)<sup>2</sup>/(2𝜎<sup>2</sup>)</sup>, for -∞ \< 𝑥 \<∞

becomes
- 𝑓(𝑋=𝑥) = (1/𝑠𝑞𝑟𝑡(2𝜋)) 𝑒<sup>-𝑥<sup>2</sup>/2</sup>, for -∞ \< 𝑥 \<∞

<strong>Z-Distribution (Standard Normal Distribution)</strong>
- is a [[Univariate Normal／Gaussian／Gauss／Laplace-Gauss﻿ Distribution／Model／Process (Bell Curve)|normal distribution]] with mean 0 and standard deviation 1
- used especially in [[Inferential Statistical Hypothesis Testing|testing hypotheses]] about [[Sample Mean|sample means]] or [[Sample Proportion|sample proportions]] of samples drawn from populations whose population standard deviations are <strong>known</strong>

<strong>Standardization</strong>
- turns any [[Univariate Normal／Gaussian／Gauss／Laplace-Gauss﻿ Distribution／Model／Process (Bell Curve)|normal distribution]] into a standard normal distribution and therefore one could us the z-table to look up its corresponding area under the curve
- outputs a standardized value

<strong>Standardized Values</strong> (also called <strong>Standard Scores</strong>, <strong>Normal Deviates</strong>, <strong>Z-Scores (𝑧\*)</strong>):
- gives you an idea of how far from the mean a data point is
- but more technically it’s a measure of how many standard deviations below or above the mean a data point is
- tells us how far from the mean we are in terms of standard deviations
