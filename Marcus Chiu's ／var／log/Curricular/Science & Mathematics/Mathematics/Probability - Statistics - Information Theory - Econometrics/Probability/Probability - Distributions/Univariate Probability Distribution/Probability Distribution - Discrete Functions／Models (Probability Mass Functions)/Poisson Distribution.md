given a [[Arithmetic Mean - Average - Location - Expected Value - Expectation Operator|mean]] number of events that happen within unit time (𝜆):
- the number of events occurring within that unit time has <strong>Poisson Distribution</strong>
- the time between events has [[Exponential Distribution]]
- the total time of 𝛼 events has [[Gamma Distribution]]

# Probability Mass Function

𝐏(𝑋=𝑥) = 𝑒<sup>−𝜆</sup>(𝜆<sup>𝑥</sup>/𝑥!) for 𝑥 = 0, 1, 2, ...

where:
- <em>𝜆</em> = frequency, [[Arithmetic Mean - Average - Location - Expected Value - Expectation Operator|mean]] number of events to happen in unit time
- 𝑒 = 2.7183... see [[number e (Euler's number)]]
- 𝑥 = the number of "events" in question to happen in unit time

# Cumulative Distribution Function

𝐶𝐷𝐹(𝑋≤𝑥) = 𝛤(⌊𝑥+1⌋, 𝜆) / ⌊𝑥⌋!

# Moment Generating Function$M_X(t) = e^{𝜆(e^t - 1)}$
# Example
Suppose you knew that the mean number of calls to a fire station on a weekday is 8. What is the probability that on a given weekday there would be 11 calls? This problem can be solved using the following formula based on the Poisson distribution

𝜆 = 8, therefore PMF is
- 𝐏(𝑋=𝑥) = 𝑒<sup>−8</sup>(8<sup>𝑥</sup>/𝑥!)

what's the probability that on a given weekday there would be 11 calls?
- 𝐏(𝑋=11) = 𝑒<sup>−8</sup>(8<sup>11</sup>/11!)
- 𝐏(𝑋=11) = 0.072
