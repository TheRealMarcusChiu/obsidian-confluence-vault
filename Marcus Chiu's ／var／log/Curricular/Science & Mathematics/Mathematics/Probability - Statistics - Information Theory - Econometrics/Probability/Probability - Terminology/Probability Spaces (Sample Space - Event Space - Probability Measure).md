# Probability Space - Definition

A probability space is a triple (𝛺, 𝐹, 𝑃) consisting of:
- a sample space 𝛺 is the non-empty set of all possible outcomes
- the event space [[σ-Algebra - σ-Field of Sets - σ-field|σ-algebra]] 𝐹⊆2<sup>𝛺</sup> (also called σ-field) – a set of subsets of 𝛺, called events, such that:
	- 𝐹 contains the entire sample space: 𝛺∊𝐹
	- 𝐹 is closed under complements: if 𝐴∊𝐹, then also 𝛺\\𝐴∊𝐹
	- 𝐹 is closed under countable unions: if 𝐴<sub>𝑖</sub>∊ 𝐹 for 𝑖=1,2,..., then also (⋃<sub>1≤𝑖≤∞</sub> 𝐴<sub>𝑖</sub>) ∊ 𝐹
	- 𝐹 is closed under countable intersections: if 𝐴<sub>𝑖</sub>∊ 𝐹 for 𝑖=1,2,..., then also (⋂<sub>1≤𝑖≤∞</sub> 𝐴<sub>𝑖</sub>) ∊ 𝐹 <font style="color: rgb(122,134,154);">\# the corollary from the previous two properties and De Morgan’s law</font>
- the [[Probability Measure|probability measure]], 𝐏: 𝐹 → \[0, 1\], that assigns each event in the event space a probability, which is a number between 0 and 1
	- 𝐏 is [countably additive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countably_additive) (also called σ-additive): if {𝐴<sub>𝑖</sub>}<sub>1≤𝑖≤∞</sub> ⊆ 𝐹 is a countable collection of pairwise disjoint sets, then 𝐏(⋃<sub>1≤𝑖≤∞</sub> 𝐴<sub>𝑖</sub>) = 𝛴<sub>1≤𝑖≤∞</sub> 𝐏(𝐴<sub>𝑖</sub>)
	- the measure of the entire sample space is equal to one: 𝐏(𝛺) = 1
