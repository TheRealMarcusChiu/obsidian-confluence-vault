###### Random Fields
````excerpt
- a random function over an arbitrary domain (i.e. a function 𝑓(𝑥) that takes on a random value at each point 𝑥∊ℝ<sup>𝑛</sup> (or some other domain))
- is a generalization of a [[Stochastic／Random／Markov Models／Process|stochastic process]] where the underlying (time) parameter need no longer be real or integer-valued but can instead take values that are multidimensional vectors or points on some [[Manifolds (n-Dimensional Manifold (n-Manifold)|manifold]]

# Random Fields - Formal Definition
given:
- [[Probability Spaces (Sample Space - Event Space - Probability Measure)|probability space]] (𝛺, 𝐹, 𝐏)

an 𝑋-valued random field 𝑹 is a collection of 𝑋-valued random variables indexed by elements in a topological space 𝑇

in other words, a random field 𝑹 is a collection:
- {𝑅<sub>𝑡</sub> : 𝑡 ∊ 𝑇}

where each 𝑅<sub>𝑡</sub>is an 𝑋-valued random variable
