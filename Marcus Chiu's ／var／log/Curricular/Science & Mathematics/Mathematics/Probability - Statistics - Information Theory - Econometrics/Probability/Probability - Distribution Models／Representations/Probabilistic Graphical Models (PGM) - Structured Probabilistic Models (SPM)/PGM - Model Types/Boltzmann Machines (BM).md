###### Boltzmann Machines (BM)
````excerpt
- could be thought of as an extension to [[Hopfield Networks - Associative Memory Models - Ising–Lenz–Little Models - Nakano-Amari-Hopfield Networks|Hopfield Networks]] (i.e. Boltzmann Machine = Hopfield Network + stochasticity +  hidden units)
- is a [[Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) - Structured Probabilistic Models (SPM)|probabilistic graphical model]] which follows [[Boltzmann／Gibbs Distribution|Boltzmann distribution]]:
	- $p(v,h) = \frac{e^{-E(v,h)}}{\sum_{v,h} e^{-E(v,h)}}$
- where 𝐸(𝑣,ℎ) is known as the energy function
