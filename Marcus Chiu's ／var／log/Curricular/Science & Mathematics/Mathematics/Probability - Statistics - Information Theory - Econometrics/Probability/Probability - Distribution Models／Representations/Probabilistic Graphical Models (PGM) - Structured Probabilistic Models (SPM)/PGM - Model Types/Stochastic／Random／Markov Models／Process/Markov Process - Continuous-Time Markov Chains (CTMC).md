###### Markov Process - Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMC)
````excerpt
- is a continuous [[Stochastic／Random／Markov Models／Process|stochastic process]] in which, for each state, the process will change state according to an exponential random variable and then move to a different state as specified by the probabilities of a stochastic matrix

# DTMC → CTMC: One Random Variable Per State
- for every state 𝑖, add a random variable 𝑋<sub>𝑖</sub> \~ [[Exponential Distribution|𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙]](𝜆𝑖)
- this represents the state residence time distribution in CTMC
- operational behavior when in state 𝑖:
	- stay 𝐄\[𝑋<sub>𝑖</sub>\] time units in state 𝑖
	- transition to next state based on transition probability matrix 𝑇
	- repeat behavior ad infinitum

# CTMC - Components

CTMC is a tuple (𝑆,𝑅):
- 𝑆 is a finite set of states
- 𝑅 rate matrix where:
	- 𝑅\[𝑖,𝑗\] = 𝜆<sub>𝑖</sub>·𝑇\[𝑖,𝑗\]
- exit rate 𝐸(𝑠) from state 𝑠:
	- 𝐸(𝑠) = 𝑅(𝑠,𝑆) = 𝛴<sub>𝑠'∊𝑆\\{𝑠}</sub> \[ 𝑅(𝑠,𝑠') \]
- state 𝑠 is [[Markov Chain Property - State Types (Transient／Positive／Null／Recurrent／Absorbing State)|absorbing]] if:
	- 𝐸(𝑠) = 0
