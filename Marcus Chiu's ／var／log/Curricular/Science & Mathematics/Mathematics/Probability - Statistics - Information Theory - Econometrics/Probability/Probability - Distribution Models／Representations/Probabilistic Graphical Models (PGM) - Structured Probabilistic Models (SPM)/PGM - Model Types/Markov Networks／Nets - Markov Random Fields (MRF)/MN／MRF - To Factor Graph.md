- given a [[MN／MRF - To Factor Graph|Markov Network]] Graph (WITHOUT its corresponding [[MN／MRF - To Factor Graph|potential functions]]), it can be represented in MULTIPLE factor graphs
- given a [[MN／MRF - To Factor Graph|Markov Network]] Graph (WITH its corresponding [[MN／MRF - To Factor Graph|potential functions]]), it can ONLY be represented in a SINGLE factor graph

### Example

given the markov network graph as shown in the figure below, there are 2 possible factor graphs.

However, if the potential functions that came along with the Markov Network graph is: <strong>ɸ</strong> = {𝜙(𝐴, 𝐵), 𝜙(𝐵, 𝐶), 𝜙(𝐴, 𝐶)}, then only Factor Graph 2 is the correct interpretation of the tuple (Markov Network Graph, <strong>ɸ</strong>)
