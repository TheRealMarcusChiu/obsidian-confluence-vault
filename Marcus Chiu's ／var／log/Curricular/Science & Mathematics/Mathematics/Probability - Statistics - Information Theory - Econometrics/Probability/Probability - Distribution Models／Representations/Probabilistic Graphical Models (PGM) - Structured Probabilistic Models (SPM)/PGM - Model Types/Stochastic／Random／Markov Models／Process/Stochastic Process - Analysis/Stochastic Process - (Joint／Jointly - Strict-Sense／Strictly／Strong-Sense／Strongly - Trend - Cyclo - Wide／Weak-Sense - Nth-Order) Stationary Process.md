- <strong>Stationary Process</strong> (<strong>Strict-Sense/Strictly/Strong-Sense/Strongly Stationary Process</strong>) - a [[Stochastic／Random／Markov Models／Process|stochastic process]] whose <em>unconditional </em><em>[[Joint Probability Distribution (Compound - Bivariate - Multivariate - Full)|joint probability distribution]]</em> doesn't change when shifted in time. Consequently, parameters such as [[Arithmetic Mean - Average - Location - Expected Value - Expectation Operator|mean]] and [[Variance - Standard Deviation (Root Mean Square (RMS) Deviation)|variance]] also don't change when shifted over time
- <strong>Cyclo-Stationary Process</strong> - a stochastic process that varies cyclically with time

The most common cause of violation of stationarity is a trend in the mean, which can be due to either:
- presence of a unit root - stochastic shocks have permanent effects, and the process is not mean-reverting
- deterministic trend - the process is called a <strong>Trend Stationary Process</strong>, and stochastic shocks have only transitory effects after which the variable tends toward a deterministically evolving (non-constant) mean

A <strong>Trend Stationary Process</strong> is not strictly stationary, but can easily be transformed into a stationary process by removing the underlying trend, which is solely a function of time. Similarly, processes with one or more unit-roots can be made stationary through differencing

For many applications, strict-sense stationarity is too restrictive. Other forms of stationarity are employed such as:
- <strong>Wide/Weak-Sense Stationarity (WSS)</strong> - a random process whose [[Stochastic Process - Mean Function|mean function]] and [[Autocorrelation - Autocovariance - Auto／Serial Correlation／Covariance Function|correlation function]] doesn't change when shifted over time
- <strong>N<sup>th</sup>-Order Stationarity</strong> -
