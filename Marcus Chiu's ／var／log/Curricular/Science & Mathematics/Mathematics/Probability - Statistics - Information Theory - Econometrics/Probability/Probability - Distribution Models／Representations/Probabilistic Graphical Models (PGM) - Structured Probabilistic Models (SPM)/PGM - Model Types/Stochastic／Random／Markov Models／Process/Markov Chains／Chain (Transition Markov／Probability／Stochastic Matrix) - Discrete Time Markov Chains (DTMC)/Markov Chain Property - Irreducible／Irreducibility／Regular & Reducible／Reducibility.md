- a [[Markov Chains／Chain (Transition Markov／Probability／Stochastic Matrix) - Discrete Time Markov Chains (DTMC)|Markov Chain]] is <strong>irreducible</strong>/<strong>regular</strong> if every state is reachable from each other
- a [[Markov Chains／Chain (Transition Markov／Probability／Stochastic Matrix) - Discrete Time Markov Chains (DTMC)|Markov Chain]] is <strong>reducible</strong> if there are states that are NOT reachable from each other

# Irreducible/Regular Markov Chain

A Markov chain is irreducible if for all states 𝑎,𝑏∊{𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒-𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑒}, there exists a time 𝑡\>0 such that
- 𝐏(𝑋<sub>𝑡</sub>=𝑏|𝑋<sub>0</sub>=𝑎) \> 0

In other words, there is a non-zero probability to get to state 𝑏 from state 𝑎 after some 𝑡 time transitions
