# Markov Property in Stochastic Processes
- <strong>Markov Property</strong> refers to the memory-less property of a [[Stochastic／Random／Markov Models／Process|stochastic process]]
	- <strong>First-Order Markov Property</strong> - probability of an observation at time 𝑡 only depends on the observation at time 𝑡-1
	- <strong>Second-Order Markov Property</strong> - probability of an observation at time 𝑡 depend on both 𝑡-1 and 𝑡-2
	- <strong>N<sup>th</sup>-Order Markov Property</strong> - probability of an observation at time 𝑡 depend on all {𝑡-1, ..., 𝑡-𝑛}

# Markov Property in Bayesian Networks
- <strong>Markov Condition/Assumption</strong> that every node in a [[Bayesian Networks (BN)|Bayesian Network]] is [[Probability Independence (Marginal Independence - Conditional Independence)|conditionally independent]] of its non-descendents, given its parents
- <strong>Causal Markov Condition (CMC) </strong>states that, conditional on the set of all its direct causes, a node is independent of all variables which are not direct causes or direct effects of that node

The 2 conditions are equivalent, iff the structure of a Bayesian Network accurately depicts [[Causality (Necessary - Sufficient - Contributory)|causality]]. However, a network may accurately embody the Markov Condition without depicting causality, in which case it should not be assumed to embody the Causal Markov Condition

Given an undirected graph 𝐆=(𝑉,𝐸), a set of random variables 𝐗<strong>=(𝑋<sub>𝑣</sub>)</strong><sub>𝑣∈𝑉</sub> indexed by 𝑉:

```merge-table

    ],

    ]
  ],
  "tableStyle": "width: 100.0%;"

The Global Markov Property is stronger than the Local Markov Property, which in turn is stronger than the Pairwise Markov Property. However, the above three Markov Properties are equivalent for a positive probability
