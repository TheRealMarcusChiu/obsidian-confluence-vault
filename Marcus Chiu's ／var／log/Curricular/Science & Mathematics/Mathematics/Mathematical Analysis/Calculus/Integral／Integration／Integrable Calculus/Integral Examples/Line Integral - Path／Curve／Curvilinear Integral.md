# Line Integral of a Scalar-Valued Function

For some scalar-valued function 𝑓: ℝ<sup>𝑛</sup> → ℝ, the line integral along a [piecewise smooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise_smooth)[curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve) 𝐶⊂ℝ<sup>𝑛</sup> is defined as:
- $\int_C f(𝐫)ds = \int_a^b f(𝐫(t)) |𝐫'(t)| dt$

where:
- 𝐫: \[𝑎,𝑏\] → 𝐶 is an arbitrary [[Function - Injective／Injection／One-to-one - Surjective／Surjection／Unto／Onto - Bijective／Bijection／One-to-one Correspondence|bijective]][parametrization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation) of the curve 𝐶 such that 𝐫(𝑎) and 𝐫(𝑏) give the endpoints of 𝐶 and 𝑎\<𝑏
- 𝑑𝑠 may be interpreted as an elementary arc length of curve 𝐶

# Line Integral of a Vector-Valued Function

For some vector-valued function 𝑓: ℝ<sup>𝑛</sup> → ℝ<sup>𝑛</sup>, the line integral along a [piecewise smooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise_smooth)[curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve) 𝐶⊂ℝ<sup>𝑛</sup> in direction 𝑟 is defined as:
- $\int_C f(𝐫)d𝐫 = \int_a^b f(𝐫(t))·|𝐫'(t)| dt$

where:
- 𝑟 represents the [[Dot Product - Scalar Product - Canonical／Euclidean／Standard Inner Product|dot product]]
