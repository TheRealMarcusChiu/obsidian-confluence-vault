###### Laplacian Operator (𝛻·𝛻 | 𝛻·𝛻𝑓 | 𝛻² | 𝛻²𝑓 | 𝛥 | 𝛥𝑓)
````excerpt
- can be thought of as an extension of the second-order derivative 𝑑<sup>2</sup>𝑓/𝑑𝑥<sup>2</sup> but for a [[Scalar-Valued Functions - Scalar Fields|scalar-valued function]]
- is defined as the [[Divergence (𝛻· ｜ 𝛻·𝑓)|divergence (𝛻·)]] of the [[Derivative of Scalar-Valued Function (Partial Derivative - Total Derivative - Gradient - Directional Directive - Second Order Partial Derivative)|gradient (𝛻𝑓)]]
- if 𝑓 is a twice-differentiable scalar-valued function, then the <em>Laplacian</em> of 𝑓 is a scalar-valued function defined by:
	- $𝛥f = \nabla^2f = \nabla·\nabla f$
- explicitly, the Laplacian of 𝑓 is the sum of all the unmixed second partial derivatives in the Cartesian coordinates 𝑥<sub>𝑖</sub>:
	- $𝛥f = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{𝜕^2f}{𝜕x_i^2}$
