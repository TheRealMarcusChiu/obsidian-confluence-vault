###### Wavelet Transform (WT)
````excerpt
- generalizes the [[Fourier Transform - Inverse Fourier Transform|Fourier transform]] and is better suited to multi-scale data
- it is like the [[Gabor Transforms (GT)|Gabor Transform]] but takes advantage of the idea that lower frequencies tend to last for a long time, and higher frequencies tend to change faster in time

# Wavelet Types
- Haar Wavelet - is a sequence of rescaled "square-shaped" functions which together form a wavelet family or basis
- Daubechies Wavelets - are a family of orthogonal wavelets defining a discrete wavelet transform
- Ricker Wavelet - Mexican Hat Wavelet
- Coiflet Wavelet - are discrete wavelets
- Meyer Wavelet -
- Shannon Wavelet -
- Guassian Wavelet -
- Symlet Wavelet -
- Morlet Wavelet -
