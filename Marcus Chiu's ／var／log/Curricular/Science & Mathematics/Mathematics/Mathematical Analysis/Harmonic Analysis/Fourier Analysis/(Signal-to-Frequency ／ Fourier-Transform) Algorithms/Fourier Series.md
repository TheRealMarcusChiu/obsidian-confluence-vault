###### Fourier Series
````excerpt
- is a way of representing a periodic function as a (possibly infinite) sum of [[Sine Function|sine]] and [[Cosine Function|cosine]] functions
	- for functions that are not periodic, the [[Fourier Transform - Inverse Fourier Transform|Fourier transform]] is used in place of the <em>Fourier series</em>
	- for functions of two variables that are periodic in both variables, the trigonometric basis in the Fourier series is replaced by the [[Spherical Harmonics|spherical harmonics]]
- is a continuous transformation of a continuous periodic signal
- is analogous to a [[Taylor Series vs Taylor Polynomial|Taylor series]], which represents functions as possibly infinite sums of monomial terms
- cases:
	- periodic function → converts into a discrete [[Exponential Function|exponential function]] or sine and cosine function
	- non-periodic function → not applicable

# Fourier Series - Definition

> [!expand-ui]- Cosine & Sine Form
> The Fourier series of a periodic function 𝑓(𝑥) of period 𝑃 is:
> - $f(x) = \frac{A_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^∞ [A_n cos(2\pi\frac{n}{P}x) + B_n sin(2\pi \frac{n}{P}x)]$

> where:
> - 𝑃 - is the interval length of the repeating period
> - $A_n = \frac{2}{P} \int_0^P f(x) cos(2\pi \frac{n}{P} x) dx \;\;\; \text{for } n ≥ 1$
> - $B_n = \frac{2}{P} \int_0^P f(x) sin(2\pi \frac{n}{P} x) dx \;\;\; \text{for } n ≥ 1$
