###### Fast Fourier Transform
````excerpt
- is an [[Algorithms|algorithm]] that computes the [[Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) - Discrete Fourier Series|discrete Fourier transform (DFT)]] of a sequence FAST, or its inverse ([[Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT)|IDFT]])
	- direct computation of the DFT is computationally expensive, with a complexity of 𝑂(𝑁<sup>2</sup>)
	- FFTs, like the [[Cooley-Tukey FFT|Cooley-Tukey]] algorithm, reduce this complexity to 𝑂(𝑁 𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑁) by exploiting the symmetries and redundancies in the DFT calculation
