###### Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT)
````excerpt
- takes DISCRETE signal as input and outputs a CONTINUOUS frequency spectrum
- it's defined by an infinite summation over the discrete-time signal
- while mathematically powerful, the DTFT is not directly computable on a computer because of its continuous nature and infinite summation
- thus [[Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) - Discrete Fourier Series]] is a computationally efficient way to approximate the DTFT
