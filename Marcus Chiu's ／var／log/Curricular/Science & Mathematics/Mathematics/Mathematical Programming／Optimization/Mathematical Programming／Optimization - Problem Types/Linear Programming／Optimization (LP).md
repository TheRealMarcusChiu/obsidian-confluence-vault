###### Linear Programming (LP) - Linear Optimization
````excerpt
- a type of [[Mathematical Programming／Optimization|mathematical optimization]] that achieves the best outcome (e.g. maximum profit or lowest cost) in a [[Mathematical Model|mathematical model]] whose requirements are represented by linear relationships

# LP - Example Problems
> [!expand]- Toy Problem
> given:
> - a toy company make 2 toys: x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub>
> - these toys are made of 2 materials: A and B
> - to make toy x<sub>1</sub>, it needs 5 units of A and 2 units of B
> - to make toy x<sub>2</sub>, it needs 3 units of A and 3 units of B
> - there is a maximum of 30 units of A
> - there is a maximum of 20 units of B
> - each toy x<sub>1</sub> can be sold for \$10
> - each toy x<sub>2</sub> can be sold for \$7
>
> what is the optimum product mix that maximizes the profit?

# LP - Theorems

> [!expand-ui]- Theorem #1
> If an LP has an optimal solution, then the optimal solution would be at the corner point of the feasible region

> [!expand-ui]- Theorem #2
> every LP either:
> - has a unique optimal solution
> - has multiple/infinite optimal solutions
> - infeasible - no feasible solution
> - unbounded - no feasible solution that is maximal
