# LP Solvers
<strong>LP solvers </strong>are general [[Algorithms|algorithms]] in solving [[Linear Programming／Optimization (LP)|Linear Programming]] [[Problems|problems]]

    [

    ]
  ]
}
```

both the Simplex Method and Interior-Point Method are not strongly polynomial time bounded.
- <strong>weakly bounded</strong> - where the worst-case running time is bounded in terms of the value of variables and constraints only
- <strong>strongly bounded</strong> - where the worst-case running time is bounded in number of variables and constraints only (i.e. independently from values of variables and constraints)

no LP Solver is found to be strongly polynomial time bounded
