###### σ-Algebra - σ-Field of Sets - σ-field
````excerpt
- Let 𝑋 be some set, and let 𝑃(𝑋) represent its [[Set Operators／Operations|power set]]. Then a subset 𝐹⊆𝑃(𝑋) is called a <strong>σ-algebra</strong> if it satisfies the following three properties:
	- 𝐹 contains 𝑋: 𝑋∊𝐹
	- 𝐹 is closed under complements: if 𝐴∊𝐹, then also 𝑋\\𝐴∊𝐹
	- 𝐹 is closed under countable unions: if 𝐴<sub>𝑖</sub>∊ 𝐹 for 𝑖=1,2,..., then also (⋃<sub>1≤𝑖≤∞</sub> 𝐴<sub>𝑖</sub>) ∊ 𝐹
	- 𝐹 is closed under countable intersections: if 𝐴<sub>𝑖</sub>∊ 𝐹 for 𝑖=1,2,..., then also (⋂<sub>1≤𝑖≤∞</sub> 𝐴<sub>𝑖</sub>) ∊ 𝐹 <font style="color: rgb(122,134,154);">\# the corollary from the previous two properties and De Morgan’s law</font>
- the ordered pair (𝑋,𝛴) is called a [[Measurable Space - Borel space|measurable space]]
- is a type of [[Field of Sets]] that is closed under countable instead of finite
