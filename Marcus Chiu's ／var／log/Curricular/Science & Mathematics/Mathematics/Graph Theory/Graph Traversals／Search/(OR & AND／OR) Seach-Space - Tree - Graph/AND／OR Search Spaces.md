<strong>AND/OR Search Spaces</strong> can capture the independencies in the graphical model to yield [[AND／OR Search Trees (AOT)|AND/OR Search Trees]] that are exponentially smaller than the standard search tree (OR Search Tree). AND/OR search tree is bounded exponentially by the [[Tree - Depth & Height|height]] of a [[Pseudo Tree - Extended Graph|pseudo tree]] that spans the graphical model. The AND/OR Search Tree may contain redundancy and can be removed yielding AND/OR Search Graphs. These additional savings can reduce the size of the AND/OR Search Space further to the point that it can be guaranteed to be no larger than exponentially in the graphical model [[Cluster／Clique／Join／Junction Trees - Tree Decompositions - Tree-Width|treewidth]]
