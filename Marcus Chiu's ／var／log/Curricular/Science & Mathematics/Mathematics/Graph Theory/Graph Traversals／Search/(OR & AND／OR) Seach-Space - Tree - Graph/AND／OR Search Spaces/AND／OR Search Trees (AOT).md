### AND/OR Search Tree - Definition

given:
- [[Graphical Models|graphical model]] 𝒢 = ⟨<strong>𝐗</strong>, <strong>𝐃</strong>, 𝐒, <strong>𝐅</strong>, <strong>𝐂</strong>⟩
- primal graph 𝐺 of 𝒢
- guiding [[Pseudo Tree - Extended Graph|pseudo tree]] 𝑇 of 𝐺

the associated <strong>AND/OR Search Tree</strong> 𝑆<sub>𝑇</sub>(𝒢):
- has alternating levels of AND and OR nodes:
- its structure is based on the underlying [[Pseudo Tree - Extended Graph|pseudo tree]] 𝑇:
	- its root is an OR node labeled by the root of 𝑇
	- its parent-child relationship between nodes in the search space are defined as follows:
		- an OR node 𝑂 has a child AND node 𝐴, iff it is consistent with the assignment from root node to node 𝐴 (consistency is defined relative to the constraints when we have a constraint problem)
		- an AND node 𝐴 has a child OR node 𝑂, iff 𝑂 is a child of 𝐴 in the guiding [[Pseudo Tree - Extended Graph|pseudo tree]] 𝑇

### AND/OR Search Tree - To AND/OR Search Graph

It is often the case that a search space that is a tree can become a graph if nodes that root identical search subspaces, or correspond to identical subproblems, are identified. Any two such nodes can be merged, yielding a graph and thus reducing the size of the search space
