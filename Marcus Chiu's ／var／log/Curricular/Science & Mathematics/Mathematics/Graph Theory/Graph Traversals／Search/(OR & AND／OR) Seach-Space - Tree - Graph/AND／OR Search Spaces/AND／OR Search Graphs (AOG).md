It is often the case that a search space that is a tree can become a graph if nodes that root identical search subspaces, or correspond to identical subproblems, are identified. Any two such nodes can be merged, yielding a graph and thus reducing the size of the search space

# AND/OR Search Graph - Intuition on Merging Subtrees (Context Minimal AND/OR Search Graph "CM-AOG")

> [!expand]- Click here to expand...
> Assume a given weighted AND/OR search graph 𝑆<sub>𝑇</sub>' of a [[Graphical Models|graphical model]] 𝒢 and assume two paths: 𝑝<sub>1</sub> and 𝑝<sub>2</sub> ending at nodes at level 𝑖 and having the same label 𝑥<sub>𝑖</sub>. These nodes can be merged iff the weighted search subgraphs rooted at these nodes are identical. The merge operator, 𝑚𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑒(𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒-1, 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒-2), redirects all the arcs going into 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒-2 into 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒-1 and removes 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒-2 and its subgraph

> We can generate the AND/OR search tree and then recursively merge identical subtrees going from leaves to root. This, however, requires generating the whole search tree first, which would still be costly. It turns out that for some nodes it is possible to recognize that they can be merged by using graph properties only, namely based on their contexts. The context of a variable is the set of its ancestor variables in the pseudo tree T that completely determine the conditioned subproblems below it
>
> The general idea of a context is to identify a minimal set of ancestor variables, along the path from the root to the node in the pseudo tree, such that when assigned the same values they yield the same conditioned subproblem, regardless of value assigned to the other ancestors
