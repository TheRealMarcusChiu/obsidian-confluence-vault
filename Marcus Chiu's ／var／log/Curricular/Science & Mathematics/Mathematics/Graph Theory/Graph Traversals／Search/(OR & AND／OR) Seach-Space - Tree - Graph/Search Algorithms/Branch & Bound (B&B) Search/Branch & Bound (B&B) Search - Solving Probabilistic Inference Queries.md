This article goes over using [[Branch & Bound (B&B) Search]] to solve [[Probabilistic Inference - Query／Task Types (Posterior Conditional - Prior Marginal ／ Probability of Evidence - MPE - MAP)|probabilistic queries]] over a given [[Probability - Distribution Models／Representations|probabilistic model]]. Other algorithms are used to solve probabilistic inference queries [[Probabilistic Inference - Algorithms|probabilistic inference algorithms]].

B&B Algorithm only solves the <em>most probable assignment</em> queries such as:
- MPE Queries
- MAP Queries

> For the rest of the examples, we choose OR-Tree as our search space type. There are other types such as:
> - OR-Graph
> - AND/OR Tree
> - AND/OR Graph

> ### Naive Method
>
> the naive way, we construct the entire OR-Search Tree (shown below)
> - at each leaf node, we compute its probability
> - select path with the highest leaf probability
>
> The problem is that the size of the OR-Tree is exponential to the number of variables!

> ### B&B Method
>
> Instead of constructing the entire OR-Tree, we estimate the upper bound of each node before traversing down. If it is smaller than the current MPE solution we choose not to traverse down that sub-tree (in a sense we prune). The amount of pruning depends on the quality of the upper-bound: lower the upper-bound → more pruning → faster search

> 	- then, maximizing out the MAP variables
