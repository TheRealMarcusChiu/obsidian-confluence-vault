### Ways Finding Minimum Cut of a Graph

the minimum cut between 2 specified nodes can be obtained as a by-product of the [[Maximum／Max Flow|maximum flow]] computation. If however, we want an overall minimum cut of the whole graph, then a single maximum flow computation does not suffice

One can find the overall minimum cut directly, without using anything about maximum flows. Below we present 2 algorithms for this problem
```dataview
LIST
FROM ""
WHERE file.folder = this.file.folder + "/" + this.file.name
```
