### Maximum Independent/Disjoint Paths Problem Types
- <strong>maximum edge-independent/disjoint paths problem</strong> - find max number of <strong>edge</strong>-disjoint s-t paths (2 paths are <strong>edge</strong>-independent/disjoint if they have no <strong>arc/edge</strong> in common)
- <strong>maximum node-independent/disjoint paths problem</strong> - find max number of <strong>node</strong>-disjoint s-t paths (2 paths are <strong>node</strong>-independent/disjoint if they have no <strong>vertex/node</strong> in common)

### Solving Maximum Edge-Independent/Disjoint Paths Problem With Maximum Flow
- assign each directed edge with a unit capacity
- then apply [[Maximum／Max Flow|MaxFlow]] algorithm

<strong>THEOREM:</strong> there are k edge-independent/disjoint paths from s to t if and only if the [[Maximum／Max Flow|max flow]] value is k
