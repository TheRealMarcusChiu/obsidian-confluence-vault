This is why \"P = NP?\" is such a famous question.\n- Example\n\t- 3-SAT. This is the problem wherein we are given conjunction (ANDs) of 3-clause disjunctions (ORs), statements of the form\n\t\t- (x<sub>11</sub> OR x<sub>21</sub> OR x<sub>31</sub>) AND\n\t\t- (x<sub>12</sub> OR x<sub>22</sub> OR x<sub>32</sub>) AND\n\t\t- ...
