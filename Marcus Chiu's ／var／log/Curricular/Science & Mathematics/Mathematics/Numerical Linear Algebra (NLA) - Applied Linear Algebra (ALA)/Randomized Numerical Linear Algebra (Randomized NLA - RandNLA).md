# RandNLA - Algorithm

RandNLA algorithms involve taking an input matrix; constructing a “sketch” of that input matrix—where a sketch is a smaller or sparser matrix that represents the essential information in the original matrix—by random sampling; and then using that sketch as a surrogate for the full matrix to help compute quantities of interest.

To be useful, the sketch should be similar to the original matrix in some way. Several basic design principles underlie much of RandNLA:
