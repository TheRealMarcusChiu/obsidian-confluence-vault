- <strong>Queueing Theory</strong> is the mathematical study of waiting for lines or queues.
- <strong>Scheduling</strong> is the method by which work is assigned to resources that complete the work
- <strong>work </strong>- also tasks, jobs, or [[Program - Process - Threads - Heavyweight／Kernel／OS／Lightweight／Virtual／User-Mode Threads ／ Fibers - Task (Software)|processes]]
