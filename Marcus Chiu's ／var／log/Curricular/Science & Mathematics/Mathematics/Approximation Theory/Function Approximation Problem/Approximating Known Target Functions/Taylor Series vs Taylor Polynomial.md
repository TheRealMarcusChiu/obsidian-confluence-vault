###### Taylor Series vs Taylor Polynomial
````excerpt
- is a representation of a [[Functions (Domain - Codomain - Preimage - Image - Range)|function]] as a sum of terms that are calculated from the values of the function's [[Explicit Differentiation／Derivative／Differentiable／Differential Functions (differentiable at a point - differentiable over an interval - differentiable everywhere／over the entire domain)|derivatives]] at a single point
	- <strong>Taylor series</strong> is an infinite sum
	- <strong>Taylor polynomial</strong> is a finite sum
- goal is to take a non-polynomial function and represent it as a polynomial function (which is easier to understand and manipulate)
- transforms: derivative information at a point → approximation information near that point
