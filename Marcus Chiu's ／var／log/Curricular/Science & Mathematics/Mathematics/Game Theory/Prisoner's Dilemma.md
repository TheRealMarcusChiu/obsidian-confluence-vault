###### Prisoner's Dilemma
````excerpt
- is a game analyzed in [[Game Theory|game theory]]
- it is a thought experiment that challenges 2 rational agents to a dilemma:
	- they could cooperate with their partner for mutual reward
	- or they could betray their partner for individual reward
- The prisoner's dilemma also illustrates that the decisions made under collective rationality may not necessarily be the same as those made under individual rationality

# Strategy

The best strategy is to choose "defect"

Because:
- If B cooperates, A should defect, because going free is better than serving 2 years
- If B defects, A should also defect because serving 5 years is better than serving 10

So, either way, A should defect since defecting is A's best response regardless of B's strategy. Parallel reasoning will show that B should defect.
