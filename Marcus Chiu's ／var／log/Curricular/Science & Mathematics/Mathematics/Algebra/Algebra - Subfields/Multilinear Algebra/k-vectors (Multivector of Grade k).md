###### k-vectors (Multivector of Grade k)
````excerpt
- is a linear combination of [[Blades - k-Blades|k-blades]]
- is a homogeneous [[Multi-Vectors／Multivectors／p-Vectors - Clifford Number - Multors|multivector]] of grade k
- is dual of a differential [[Multilinear Functionals - Multilinear Forms - k Forms - k-forms|k-form]]

# k-vector vs multivector vs k-blade

See: [[k-blades vs k-vectors vs multivectors]]
# Examples
- 0-vectors are [[Scalars|scalars]]
- 1-vectors are [[Vectors|vectors]]
- 2-vectors are [[Bivectors - Binors - 2-vectors|bivectors]]
- 3-vectors are [[Trivectors - 3-Vectors|trivectors]]

They are respectively dual to 0-forms, [[Linear Functionals - Linear Forms - 1／One-Forms - Covectors|1-forms]], [[Bilinear Functionals - Bilinear Forms - 2／Two Forms|2-forms]], and 3-forms
