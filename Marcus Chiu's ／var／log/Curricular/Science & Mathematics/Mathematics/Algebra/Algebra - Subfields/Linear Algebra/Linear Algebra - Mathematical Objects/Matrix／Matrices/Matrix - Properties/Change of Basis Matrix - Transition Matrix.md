###### Change of Basis Matrix - Transition Matrix
````excerpt
- <strong>change of basis</strong> consists of converting every assertion expressed in terms of coordinates relative to one basis into an assertion expressed in terms of coordinates relative to the other basis
- <strong>change of basis matrix</strong> is the matrix whose columns are the coordinate vectors of the new [[Basis Vectors|basis vectors]] on the old basis
