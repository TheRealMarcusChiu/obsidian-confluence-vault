###### Symmetric Matrix
- is a [[Square Matrix|square matrix]] where its transpose is equal to itself (i.e. 𝐴 = 𝐴<sup>𝑇</sup>)

# Symmetric Matrix - Properties

an 𝑛✕𝑛 symmetric matrix 𝐴 has the following properties:
- 𝐴 has 𝑛 real [[Eigenvectors (Characteristic Vectors) - Eigenvalues (Spectrum)|eigenvalues]], counting multiplicities (i.e. multiple of the same eigenvalue)
- the dimension of the eigenspace for each eigenvalue 𝜆 equals the multiplicity of 𝜆 as a root of the [[Characteristic Polynomial|characteristic equation]]
- the eigenspaces are mutually orthogonal, in the sense that eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal
- 𝐴 is [[Orthogonal Eigen／Spectral Decomposition／Factorization - Diagonalization／Diagonalizing／Diagonalize - Orthogonally Diagonalizable／Non-Defective Matrix|orthogonally diagonalizable]] (see proof here [[Spectral Theorem - 𝐴 is Orthogonally Diagonalizable ⟺ 𝐴 is Symmetric]])
