###### Basis Vectors
````excerpt
- a set 𝐵 of vectors in a [[Vector Spaces - Linear Spaces|vector space 𝑉]] is called a [[Mathematical Space (Basis)|basis]] if it is a [[Linear Independence - Linearly Independent - Linear Dependence - Linearly Dependent|linearly independent]] [[Linear Span／Hull - Span／Spans - Spanning Set|spanning set]], i.e.:
	1. every element of 𝐵 is [[Linear Independence - Linearly Independent - Linear Dependence - Linearly Dependent|linearly independent]]
	2. every element of 𝑉 is a FINITE [[Linear Combinations|linear combination]] of the elements of 𝐵 (i.e. 𝐵 [[Linear Span／Hull - Span／Spans - Spanning Set|spans]] 𝑉)
- [[Vector Spaces - Linear Spaces|vector space]] is to the <em>basis vector</em> as [[Function Spaces|function space]] is to the [[Basis Functions|basis function]]
- is a (0,1)-[[Tensors|tensor]] (except for the [[Dual Basis - Dual Basis Covectors／Vectors - Dual Sets - Reciprocal Basis|dual basis covectors]])
