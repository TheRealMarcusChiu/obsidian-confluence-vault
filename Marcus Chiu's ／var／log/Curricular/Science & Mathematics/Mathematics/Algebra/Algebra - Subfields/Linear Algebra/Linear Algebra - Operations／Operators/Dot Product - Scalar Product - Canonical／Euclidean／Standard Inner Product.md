###### Dot Product - Scalar Product - Canonical/Euclidean/Standard Inner Product (𝑣·𝑢)
````excerpt
- is a type of [[Inner Products|inner product (⟨·,·⟩)]] that takes as input 2 equal length [[Vectors|vectors]]
- because it results in a single value, the operation is often referred to as the <em>scalar product</em>
````
^excerpt

the following are equivalent:
- 𝑣·𝑢
- 𝛴<sub>1≤𝑖≤𝑛</sub>(𝑣<sub>𝑖</sub>𝑢<sub>𝑖</sub>)
- (length of projected 𝑣 onto 𝑢)·(length of 𝑢)
- (length of projected 𝑢 onto 𝑣)·(length of 𝑣)

for example
- \[1, 2, 3\]<sup>𝑇</sup>·\[4, 5, 6\]<sup>𝑇</sup> = (1\*4) + (2\*5) + (3\*6) = 32

# Orthogonality

If the dot product of 2 vectors equals 0 then these vectors are orthogonal

# Similarity with Linear Transformations of Multi-Dimensional Vectors to 1-Dimensional Vector

the dot product has close ties with the<strong> (linear transformation 1×N matrix</strong> or <strong>[[Projection／Idempotent Matrix (Projections onto Subspaces)|projection matrix]]) </strong>that transforms a multi-dimensional vector into a one-dimensional vector (i.e. scalar value)
###### Consider the 2 Dimensional Case

say the linear transformation 1×2 matrix = \[5, 6\]

use the matrix to transform the basis vectors 𝑖 and 𝑗 of the 2D vector space:
- \[5, 6\]𝑖 = \[5, 6\]\[1, 0\]<sup>𝑇</sup>= \[5\] <font style="color: rgb(128,128,128);">\# </font><font style="color: rgb(128,128,128);">basis vector 𝑖 \[1, 0\] is transformed to \[5\]</font>
- \[5, 6\]𝑗 = \[5, 6\]\[0, 1\]<sup>𝑇</sup>= \[6\] <font style="color: rgb(128,128,128);">\# basis vector 𝑗 \[0, 1\] is transformed to \[6\]</font>

therefore any vector (represented in basis vector notation) can be transformed by multiplying its 𝑖 component by 5 and its 𝑗 component by 6. and finally summing the products
