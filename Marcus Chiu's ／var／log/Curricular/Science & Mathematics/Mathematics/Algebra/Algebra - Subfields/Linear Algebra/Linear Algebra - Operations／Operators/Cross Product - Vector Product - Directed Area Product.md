# Cross Product - Defined Computationally

Given two 3D vectors 𝑣 and 𝑢:
- $v = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \\ \end{bmatrix} \;\;\; u = \begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \\ \end{bmatrix}$

The cross product of 𝑣⨯𝑢 is defined as:
- $v×u = determinant( \begin{bmatrix} i & v_1 & u_1 \\ j & v_2 & u_2 \\ k & v_3 & u_3 \\ \end{bmatrix} )$
- $v×u = (v_2u_3 - v_3u_2)\hat{i} + (v_3u_1 - v_1u_3)\hat{j} + (v_1u_2 - v_2u_1)\hat{k}$
- $v×u = v = \begin{bmatrix} v_2u_3 - v_3u_2 \\ v_3u_1 - v_1u_3 \\ v_1u_2 - v_2u_1 \\ \end{bmatrix}$

# Cross Product - Defined Geometrically

What vector 𝑝=\[𝑝<sub>1</sub>, 𝑝<sub>2</sub>, 𝑝<sub>3</sub>\] has the property that:
- $\begin{bmatrix} p_1 \\ p_2 \\ p_3 \\ \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \\ \end{bmatrix} = determinant( \begin{bmatrix} x & v_1 & u_1 \\ y & v_2 & u_2 \\ z & v_3 & u_3 \\ \end{bmatrix} )$

(area of parallelogram defined by 𝑣 and 𝑢)(component of \[𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧\] perpendicular to 𝑣 and 𝑢)
(area of parallelogram defined by 𝑣 and 𝑢)(magnitude of projection onto line perpendicular to 𝑣 and 𝑢)

same as

(area of parallelogram defined by 𝑣 and 𝑢)(taking [[Dot Product - Scalar Product - Canonical／Euclidean／Standard Inner Product|dot-product]] of \[𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧\] and a vector thats perpendicular to 𝑣 and 𝑢)
# Cross Product - Properties

Given [[Standard Basis Vectors|standard basis / unit vectors]] 𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘; the following holds:
- 𝑖 × 𝑗 = 𝑘
- 𝑗 × 𝑖 = -𝑘
- 𝑗 × 𝑘 = 𝑖
- 𝑘 × 𝑗 = -𝑖
- 𝑘 × 𝑖 = 𝑗
- 𝑖 × 𝑘 = -𝑗

non linear independence
- 𝑖 × 𝑖 = 0
- 𝑗 × 𝑗 = 0
- 𝑘 × 𝑘 = 0

𝑣 × 𝑢 = 𝑝, where:
- 𝑝's magnitude equals area of parallelogram of sides 𝑣 and 𝑢
- 𝑝 is perpendicular to 𝑣 and 𝑢
