###### Topology (𝜏)
````excerpt
- used to measure closeness
- when paired with its elements (𝑋) it forms a [[Topological Spaces|topological space (𝑋,𝜏)]]
- a <em>topology (𝜏)</em> on a set 𝑋 is defined as a collection of subsets of 𝑋, called open sets<strong>,</strong> and satisfies the following axioms:
	1. the [empty set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set) and 𝑋 itself belong to 𝜏:
		1. 𝑋∈𝜏 and ∅∈𝜏
	2. any arbitrary (finite or infinite) union of sets of 𝜏 belongs to 𝜏:
		1. if {𝑈<sub>𝑖</sub> : 𝑖∈𝐼} ⊆ 𝜏 then ⋃<sub>𝑖∊𝐼</sub>𝑈<sub>𝑖</sub> ∈ 𝜏
	3. the intersection of any finite number of sets of 𝜏 belongs to 𝜏:
		1. if 𝑈<sub>1</sub>, …, 𝑈<sub>𝑛</sub> ∈ 𝜏 then 𝑈<sub>1</sub> ∩ ⋯ ∩ 𝑈<sub>𝑛</sub> ∈ 𝜏
- a [[Distance Measures／Metrics／Semi-Metrics／Functions|distance metric (𝑑)]] induces a <em>t</em><em>opology (𝜏<sub>𝑑</sub>)</em> where the set { 𝐵<sub>𝑑</sub>(𝑥,𝜖) | 𝑥∈𝑋 and 𝜖\>0 } forms the [[Basis Vectors|basis]] of a [[Distance Metric Topology|metric topology (𝜏𝑑)]], where 𝐵<sub>𝑑</sub>(𝑥,𝜖) is an [[Metric Spaces (Epsilon Balls - Open Sets - Boundary Points／Sets - Closed Sets - Closures - Bounded Sets ／ Boundedness - Unbounded Sets ／ Unboundedness - Totally Bounded Sets ／ Totally Boundedness)|epsilon-ball/open-set]] defined as 𝐵<sub>𝑑</sub>(𝑥,𝜖) = { 𝑦∈𝑋 : 𝑑(𝑥,𝑦) \< 𝜖 }

# Topological - Examples
1. Given 𝑋 = {1,2,3,4}, the family 𝜏 = {{},{2},{1,2},{2,3},{1,2,3},{1,2,3,4}} = {∅,{2},{1,2},{2,3},{1,2,3},𝑋} of six subsets of 𝑋 forms another topology of 𝑋
2. Given 𝑋 = ℤ, the set of integers, the family 𝜏 of all finite subsets of the integers plus ℤ itself is <em>not</em> a topology, because (for example) the union of all finite sets not containing zero is not finite and therefore not a member of the family of finite sets. The union of all finite sets not containing zero is also not all of ℤ, and so it cannot be in 𝜏
```merge-table
{
  "rows": [
    [
      "![[Topology/topological-space-examples.png]]",
      "Let 𝜏 be denoted with the circles.\n\nHere are four examples and two non-examples of topologies on the three-point set {1,2,3}.\n\nThe bottom-left example is not a topology because the union of {2} and {3} \\[i.e. {2,3}\\] is missing\n\nThe bottom-right example is not a topology because the intersection of {1,2} and {2,3} \\[i.e. {2}\\], is missing."
