````excerpt
- is a type of [[Mathematical Spaces|mathematical space]]
- is a [[Dual Spaces|dual space]]
- if 𝑉 is a [[Vector Spaces - Linear Spaces|vector space]] over a [[Algebraic Structures|field]] 𝐹, the set of all [[Linear Functionals - Linear Forms - 1／One-Forms - Covectors|linear functionals]] from 𝑉 to 𝐹 is itself a vector space over 𝐹. This space is called the <em>algebraic dual space</em> of 𝑉
- any [[Vector Spaces - Linear Spaces|vector space (𝑉,𝐹)]] over a [[Fields (Algebraic Structure) - Field Theory|field (𝐹)]] has a corresponding <em>dual space (𝑉\*)</em> defined as the set of all [[Linear Functionals - Linear Forms - 1／One-Forms - Covectors|linear functionals]] (𝜑 : 𝑉 → 𝐹). The <em>dual space (𝑉\*)</em> itself becomes a vector space over 𝐹 when equipped with addition and scalar multiplication satisfying, for all 𝜑,𝛾∊𝑉\*, 𝑥∊𝑉, and 𝑎∊𝐹:
	- (𝜑 + 𝛾)(𝑥) = 𝜑(𝑥) + 𝛾(𝑥)
	- (𝑎𝜑)(𝑥) = 𝑎(𝜑(𝑥))
- the elements of the <em>algebraic dual space (𝑉\*)</em> are sometimes called [[Linear Functionals - Linear Forms - 1／One-Forms - Covectors|linear functionals, linear forms, covectors, and one-forms]]
- the pairing of an element 𝑣∊𝑉 and a linear functional 𝜑∊𝑉\*:
	- defines a [[Non-Degenerate Bilinear Functionals - Non-Degenerate Bilinear Forms|non-degenerate bilinear functional]] ⟨·,·⟩ : 𝑉 ⨯ 𝑉\* → 𝐹 called the [natural pairing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_system)
	- is sometimes denoted by: 𝜑(𝑣) = \[𝑣,𝜑\] = ⟨𝑣,𝜑⟩

# Dual Spaces - Applications

Dual vector spaces find application in many branches of mathematics that use vector spaces, such as:
- Used in [[Tensor Calculus - Tensor Analysis - Ricci Calculus|tensor analysis]] with [[Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces|finite-dimensional vector spaces]]
- Used in [[Transpose of a Linear Transformation - Algebraic Adjoint of a Linear Transformation|Transpose of a Linear Transformation]]
- When applied to vector spaces of functions (which are typically infinite-dimensional), <em>dual spaces</em> are used to describe [[Measure／Measures|measures]], distributions, and [[Mathematical Spaces|Hilbert spaces]]. Consequently, <em>dual space</em> is an important concept in [[Functional Analysis|functional analysis]]
