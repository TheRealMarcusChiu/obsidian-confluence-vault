###### Totally Bounded Metric Spaces
````excerpt
- is a type of [[Mathematical Spaces|mathematical space]]
- is a type of [[Metric Spaces|metric space]] that is [[Metric Spaces (Epsilon Balls - Open Sets - Boundary Points／Sets - Closed Sets - Closures - Bounded Sets ／ Boundedness - Unbounded Sets ／ Unboundedness - Totally Bounded Sets ／ Totally Boundedness)|totally bounded]]
- a [[Metric Spaces|metric space (𝑋,𝑑)]] is totally bounded if and only if for every real number 𝜀\>0, there exists a FINITE collection of [[Metric Spaces (Epsilon Balls - Open Sets - Boundary Points／Sets - Closed Sets - Closures - Bounded Sets ／ Boundedness - Unbounded Sets ／ Unboundedness - Totally Bounded Sets ／ Totally Boundedness)|open balls]] of radius 𝜀 whose centers lie in 𝑋 and whose union contains 𝑋
- equivalently, a [[Metric Spaces|metric space (𝑋,𝑑)]] is totally bounded if and only if for every real number 𝜀\>0, there exists a FINITE [[Mathematical Space (Cover／Covering - Open Cover／Covering - Subcover／Subcovering)|cover]] such that the radius of each element of the cover is at most 𝜀
- any subset of a <em>totally bounded metric space</em> is a [[Metric Spaces (Epsilon Balls - Open Sets - Boundary Points／Sets - Closed Sets - Closures - Bounded Sets ／ Boundedness - Unbounded Sets ／ Unboundedness - Totally Bounded Sets ／ Totally Boundedness)|bounded set]]
- every totally bounded metric space is also a [[Bounded Metric Spaces|bounded metric space]]
