# TODO

Mappings between sets that preserve structures (i.e., structures in the domain are mapped to equivalent structures in the codomain) are of special interest in many fields of mathematics. Examples are:
- <strong>homomorphisms</strong> - mappings that preserve [[Algebraic Structures|algebraic structures]]
- <strong>homeomorphisms</strong> - mappings that preserve topological structures
- <strong> diffeomorphisms</strong> - mappings that preserve differential structures

A [morphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphism) 𝑓 : 𝑎 → 𝑏 is called
- a [monomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomorphism) (or monic) if it is left-cancellable, i.e. 𝑓𝑔<sub>1</sub> = 𝑓𝑔<sub>2</sub> implies 𝑔<sub>1</sub> = 𝑔<sub>2</sub> for all morphisms 𝑔<sub>1</sub>, 𝑔<sub>2</sub> : 𝑥 → 𝑎.
- an [epimorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimorphism) (or epic) if it is right-cancellable, i.e. 𝑔<sub>1</sub>𝑓 = 𝑔<sub>2</sub>𝑓 implies 𝑔<sub>1</sub> = 𝑔<sub>2</sub> for all morphisms 𝑔<sub>1</sub>, 𝑔<sub>2</sub> : 𝑏 → 𝑥.
- a [bimorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimorphism) if it is both a monomorphism and an epimorphism.
- a [retraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retract_(category_theory)) if it has a right inverse, i.e. if there exists a morphism 𝑔 : 𝑏 → 𝑎 with 𝑓𝑔 = 1<sub>𝑏</sub>.
- a [section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_(category_theory)) if it has a left inverse, i.e. if there exists a morphism 𝑔 : 𝑏 → 𝑎 with 𝑔𝑓 = 1<sub>𝑎</sub>.
- an [isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism) if it has an inverse, i.e. if there exists a morphism 𝑔 : 𝑏 → 𝑎 with ???? = 1<sub>𝑏</sub> and 𝑔𝑓 = 1<sub>𝑎</sub>.
- an [endomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endomorphism) if 𝑎 = 𝑏. The class of endomorphisms of a is denoted 𝑒𝑛𝑑(𝑎).
- an [automorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automorphism) if 𝑓 is both an endomorphism and an isomorphism. The class of automorphisms of 𝑎 is denoted 𝑎𝑢𝑡(𝑎).

Every retraction is an epimorphism. Every section is a monomorphism. The following three statements are equivalent:
- 𝑓 is a monomorphism and a retraction;
- 𝑓 is an epimorphism and a section;
- 𝑓 is an isomorphism.

Relations among morphisms (such as 𝑓𝑔 = ℎ) can most conveniently be represented with [commutative diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_diagram), where the objects are represented as points and the morphisms as arrows.
