###### Linear (Transformations/Operations/Operators/Mappings/Maps/Functions/Morphisms) - Vector Space Homomorphism (𝐿/𝑇 : 𝑉 → 𝑊)
````excerpt
- is a type of [[Transformations／Operations／Operators／Mappings／Maps／Functions／Morphisms|transformation (𝑇)]] between two [[Vector Spaces - Linear Spaces|vector spaces]] (𝑉 → 𝑊) that preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication
- a linear transformation (𝐿 : 𝑉 → 𝑊) assigns each vector 𝑥̅ ∊ 𝑉  to a single vector 𝐿(𝑥̅) ∊ 𝑊, such that:
	- 𝐿(𝑢̅ + 𝑣̅) = 𝐿(𝑢̅) + 𝐿(𝑣̅) <font style="color: rgb(128,128,128);">\# for all 𝑢̅, 𝑣̅ in 𝑉, linear transformation 𝐿 is distributive over vector addition</font>
	- 𝐿(𝑐𝑢̅) = 𝑐𝐿(𝑢̅) <font style="color: rgb(128,128,128);">\# for all 𝑢̅ in 𝑉 and all scalars 𝑐, linear transformation 𝐿 is commutative w.r.t. scalar multiplication of a vector</font>
- a [[Morphisms - Homomorphic／Homomorphisms (Isomorphic／Isomorphisms - Monomorphic／Monomorphisms／Injective - Epimorphic／Epimorphisms／Surjective - Endomorphic／Endomorphisms - Automorphic／Automorphisms)|homomorphism]] of vector spaces is called a <em>linear transformation</em>
- is a (1,1)-[[Tensors|tensor]]
- if a linear transformation is a [[Function - Injective／Injection／One-to-one - Surjective／Surjection／Unto／Onto - Bijective／Bijection／One-to-one Correspondence|bijection]] then it is called a <em>linear [[Morphisms - Homomorphic／Homomorphisms (Isomorphic／Isomorphisms - Monomorphic／Monomorphisms／Injective - Epimorphic／Epimorphisms／Surjective - Endomorphic／Endomorphisms - Automorphic／Automorphisms)|isomorphism]]</em>, which means the transformation is [[Invertibility／Invertible／Inverse Element - Right／Left Inverse Element|invertible]]
- if a linear transformation 𝐿 is finite (i.e. transforms from one finite space of dimension 𝑛 to another finite space of dimension 𝑚), then 𝐿 can be represented as a 𝑚⨯𝑛 [matrix](http://confluence.marcuschiu.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1023009)

# Linear Transformation - Examples
- If 𝑊 is the base [[Fields (Algebraic Structure) - Field Theory|field 𝐹]], such that (𝐿 : 𝑉 → 𝐹) then the transformation 𝐿 is called a [[Linear Functionals - Linear Forms - 1／One-Forms - Covectors|linear form]]
> [!expand]- Expected Value of a Random Variable
> The [[Arithmetic Mean - Average - Location - Expected Value - Expectation Operator|expected value]] of a [random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable#Definition) is linear, as for random variables 𝑋 and 𝑋 we have:
> - 𝐄\[𝑋+𝑌\] = 𝐄\[𝑋\] + 𝐄\[𝑌\]
> - 𝐄\[𝛼𝑋\] = 𝛼𝐄\[𝑋\]

> but the [[Variance - Standard Deviation (Root Mean Square (RMS) Deviation)|variance]] of a random variable is not linear
