# Transpose - Definition

Let 𝐿: 𝑉→𝑊 be a linear transformation. The transpose of 𝐿 is defined as:
- 𝐿<sup>T</sup>: 𝑊<sup>∗</sup>→𝑉<sup>∗</sup>

Where 𝐿<sup>T</sup>'s:
- INPUT is a linear functional 𝑓 ∊ 𝑊<sup>∗</sup> (where 𝑓: 𝑊→𝐹)
- OUTPUT is a linear functional 𝐿<sup>T</sup>(𝑓) ∊ 𝑉<sup>∗</sup> (where 𝐿<sup>T</sup>(𝑓): 𝑉→𝐹)

Thus when given any vector 𝑣∊𝑉:
- 𝐿<sup>T</sup>(𝑓)(𝑣) = 𝑓(𝐿(𝑣))

# Transpose - Properties
- given a finite [[Linear (Transformations／Operations／Operators／Mappings／Maps／Functions／Morphisms) - Vector Space Homomorphism|linear transformation (𝐿 : ℝ𝑛→ℝ𝑛)]] and a [[Dot Product - Scalar Product - Canonical／Euclidean／Standard Inner Product|standard inner product]] (⟨·,·⟩)
, we have

⟨𝐿𝑥,𝑦⟩ = ⟨𝑥,𝐿<sup>T</sup>𝑦⟩
- if 𝐿 is also an [[Orthogonal／Orthonormal／Unitary (Transformations／Operations／Operators／Mappings／Maps／Functions)|orthogonal transformation]], 𝐿 preserves the inner product between 2 vectors 𝑥 and 𝑦:
	- ⟨𝑥,𝑦⟩ = ⟨𝐴𝑥,𝐴𝑦⟩ = ⟨𝑥,𝐴<sup>T</sup>𝐴𝑦⟩ and we find that 𝐴<sup>T</sup>𝐴 = 𝐼 and 𝐴<sup>-1</sup> = 𝐴<sup>T</sup>
