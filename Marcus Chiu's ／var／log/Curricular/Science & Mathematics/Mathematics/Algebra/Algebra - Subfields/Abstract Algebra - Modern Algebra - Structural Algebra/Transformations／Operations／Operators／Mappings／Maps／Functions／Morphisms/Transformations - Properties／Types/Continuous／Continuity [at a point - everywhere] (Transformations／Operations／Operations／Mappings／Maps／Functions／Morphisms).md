# Continuous Transformations - Definitions (at a point)

> [!expand-ui]- Real-Valued Continuous Functions
> A [[Functions (Domain - Codomain - Preimage - Image - Range)|function (𝑓)]] is continuous at a point 𝑥 = 𝑎 if the following three conditions are met
> - 𝑓 is defined at 𝑥 = 𝑎
> - the limit of 𝑓 as 𝑥 approaches 𝑎 exists
> - the limit of 𝑓 as 𝑥 approaches 𝑎 is equal to the function value at 𝑥 = 𝑎
