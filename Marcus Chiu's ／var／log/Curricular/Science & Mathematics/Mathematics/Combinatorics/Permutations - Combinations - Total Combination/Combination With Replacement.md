> Suppose:
> - 𝑛 = 10
> - 𝑘 = 9
>
> We want to figure out the number of UNORDERED ways of selecting 𝑘=9 items from 𝑛=10 possible items with replacement after each selection
>
> In the figure below, we draw a circle for each time object \#1 is sampled, then draw a separating bar, then a circle for each time object \#2 is sampled, etc. Two bars next to each other mean that the corresponding object has never been sampled.

> - object \#6 chosen 0 times
> - object \#7 chosen 2 times
> - object \#8 chosen 1 time
> - object \#9 chosen 0 times
> - object \#10 chosen 0 times

> The resulting picture will always have:
> - 𝑘 circles for a sample of size 𝑘
> - (𝑛 − 1) bars separating 𝑛 objects
>
> Each picture with these conditions represents an outcome. How many outcomes are there?
>
> It is the number of allocations of 𝑘 circles among (𝑘 + 𝑛 − 1) slots available for them

> In other words, there are (𝑘 + 𝑛 - 1) distinct items and we want to choose 𝑘 of them. Also, the order doesn't matter!

> There's another way to derive the 𝐶<sub>𝑟</sub>(𝑛,𝑘) formula. Instead of choosing the allocations of 𝑘 circles, we could choose the allocations of (𝑛 − 1) bars among (𝑘 + 𝑛 - 1) slots available for them. This would result in the same formula!
