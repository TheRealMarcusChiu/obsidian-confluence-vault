# Real Numbers - Axioms

A non-empty set ℝ together with operations +,· and ordering ≤ is called the <em>real numbers</em> if it satisfies:
- (ℝ, +, 0) is an [[Abelian Groups (Algebraic Structure)|abelian group]]
- (ℝ\\{0}, ·, 1) is an [[Abelian Groups (Algebraic Structure)|abelian group]]
- · is [[Distributivity／Distributive|distributive]] over : <font style="color: rgb(122,134,154);">𝑥·(𝑦 + 𝑧) = 𝑥·𝑦 + 𝑥·𝑧</font>
- ≤ is a [[Binary Ordered Relations - Types (Partial Order - Total Order - Quasi Order)|total order]], compatible with + and · (i.e. Archimedean property)
- every [[Mathematical Space (Cauchy Sequences)|Cauchy sequence]] is a [[Metric Spaces (Sequences - Convergent／Convergence／Converges - Bounded - Cauchy Sequences)|convergent sequence]]

Given a non-empty set ℝ, we define the <em>absolute value operation</em> as follows:
- $|x| = \begin{cases} x  & \text{if } x≥0 \\ -x & \text{if } x<0 \\ \end{cases}$

With the <em>absolute value operation</em> we have the following properties:
- |𝑥 · 𝑦| = |𝑥| · |𝑦|
- |𝑥 + 𝑦| ≤ |𝑥| + |𝑦|
