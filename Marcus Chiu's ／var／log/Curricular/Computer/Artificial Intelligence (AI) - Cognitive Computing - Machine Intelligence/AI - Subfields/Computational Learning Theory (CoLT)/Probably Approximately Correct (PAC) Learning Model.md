###### Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Learning Model
````excerpt
- is a framework for the [[Mathematical Analysis|mathematical analysis]] of [[Machine Learning (ML) - Pattern Recognition|machine learning]]
- it was proposed in 1984 by [Leslie Valiant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Valiant)
- it aims to address the challenge of building models that can generalize well to unseen data
- it defines the probability that the available training data are large enough to attain the true error rate

# PAC - Framework

In this framework, the learner receives samples and must select a generalization function (called the hypothesis) from a certain class of possible functions. The goal is that, with high probability (the "probably" part), the selected function will have low generalization error (the "approximately correct" part).
