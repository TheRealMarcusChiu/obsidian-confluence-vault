###### Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown for Identifying Word Polarity
- intuition:
	- adjectives conjoined by "and" have same polarity (e.g. fair and legitimate, corrupt and brutal)
	- adjectives conjoined by "but" have different polarity (e.g. fair but brutal)
- processes:
	- start with seed set (i.e. a labelled set of sentiment words)
	- expand seed set to conjoined adjectives, which results in a graph
	- use clustering algorithm to divide the graph
