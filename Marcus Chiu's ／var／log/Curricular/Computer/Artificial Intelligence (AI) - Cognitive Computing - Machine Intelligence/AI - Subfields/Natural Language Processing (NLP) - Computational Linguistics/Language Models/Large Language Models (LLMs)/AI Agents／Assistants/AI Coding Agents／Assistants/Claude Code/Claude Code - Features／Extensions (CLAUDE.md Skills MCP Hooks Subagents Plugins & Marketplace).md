# Key Technical Distinctions
- <strong>Invocation Control:</strong> Skills can run in the current session or be offloaded to subagents for modularity
- <strong>Loading Behavior:</strong> Descriptions load at session start to minimize latency, while full content is injected only when the skill is triggered
- <strong>Portability:</strong> Use <strong>Plugins</strong> when you need to share a specific set of tools or logic across multiple different project
