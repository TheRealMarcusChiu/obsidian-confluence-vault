- extrinsic evaluation
- intrinsic evaluation
	- <strong>perplexity</strong> - the probability of the test-set, normalized by the number of words

# Extrinsic (in-vivo) Evaluation

extrinsic evaluation is the best for comparing 2 language models 𝐴 and 𝐵:
- put each model in a task (spelling corrector, speech recognizer, etc)
- get the accuracy of 𝐴 and 𝐵
	- how many misspelled words were corrected properly
	- how many words were translated correctly
- compare the accuracy of 𝐴 and 𝐵

downside is time-consuming
# Intrinsic Evaluation - Perplexity

- 𝐏𝐏(𝑊) = \[𝛱<sub>1≤𝑖≤𝑛</sub>𝐏(𝑤<sub>𝑖</sub>|𝑤<sub>1</sub>, ..., 𝑤<sub>𝑖-1</sub>)\]<sup>-(1/𝑛)</sup><font style="color: rgb(128,128,128);">\#</font> [[Probability (Product Rule - Chain Rule)|chain rule]]

minimizing perplexity ≈ maximizing probability

perplexity:
- bad approximation unless the test-data looks just like the training-data
- is related to the weighted branching factor
