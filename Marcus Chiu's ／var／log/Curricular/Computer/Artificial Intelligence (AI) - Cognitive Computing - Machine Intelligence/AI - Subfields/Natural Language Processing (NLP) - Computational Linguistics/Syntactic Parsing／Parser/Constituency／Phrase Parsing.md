###### Constituency/Phrase Parsing
- is the task of breaking text/sentences into constituents (sub-phrases and words)
	- non-terminals in the parse tree are types of phrases
	- terminals are the words in the sentence
- builds on top of [[Part-of-Speech (PoS) Tagging|PoS tagging]] by combining the tags into larger constituents/phrases
- constituency parsing with [[Context-Free Grammar (CFG) - Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG) - Backus-Naur／Normal Form (BNF)|Context-Free Grammar (CFG) or Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG)]] refers to the task of assigning proper trees to input strings/sentences
	- proper here means a tree:
		- that covers all and only elements of the input
		- has an <code><font style="color: rgb(128,128,128);">S</font></code> at the top
	- proper doesn't actually mean that the tree is correct
- involves search which involves the making of choices
