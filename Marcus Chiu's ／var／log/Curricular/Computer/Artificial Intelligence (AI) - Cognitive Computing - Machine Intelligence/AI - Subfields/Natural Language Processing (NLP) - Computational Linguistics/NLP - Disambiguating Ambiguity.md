# Disambiguating Ambiguity
- <strong>lexical disambiguation</strong>:
	- <strong>part-of-speech disambiguation</strong> - determining the correct [[Part of Speech (PoS)]] tag of a word with several possible PoS tags. [[Statistical-Based PoS Tagging - Using Hidden Markov Model (HMM)|HHMs for PoS]] can be used to solve this problem
	- <strong>word sense disambiguation</strong> - determining the correct meaning/sense of a [[Homo／Hetero-nym／nymy／graph／phone - Synonym - Polyseme／Polysemy - Capitonym - Monosemy|polysemy/homonym]] (a word with several different meanings)
- <strong>syntactic disambiguation</strong> - determining the correct parse tree among several possible trees. can be solved with probabilistic parsing
- <strong>speech act interpretation</strong> - determining whether sentence is a question or statement
