###### Decision Trees (DT)
- breaks input space into regions and has separate parameters for each region
- is a boolean-valued function
- is a type of [[ML - Experience Type (Supervised／Unsupervised／Semi-Supervised／Self-Supervised／Multi-Instance／Reinforcement Learning)|supervised learning algorithm]]
- can be either:
	- [[ML - Parametric vs Non-Parametric|parametric]] - if decision tree algorithm is regularized with size constraints
	- [[ML - Parametric vs Non-Parametric|non-parametric]] - if decision tree algorithm is allowed to learn a tree of arbitrary size

# Ways to Stop Over-Splitting
- maximum depth
- minimum records per node

# Look-Ahead
- DT algorithms uses greedy approach which may not always make the best splits down the tree
- look-ahead helps, but is computationally intensive
