###### Nearest-Neighbor Descent (NN-Descent)

is a simple yet efficient algorithm for approximate <code><em>K-Nearest Neighbor Graph (K-NNG)</em></code> construction with arbitrary [[Similarity Measures／Metrics／Semi-Metrics／Functions|similarity measures]] or [[Distance Measures／Metrics／Semi-Metrics／Functions|distance measures]]. Our method is based on local search, has minimal space overhead, and does not rely on any shared global index. Hence, it is especially suitable for large-scale applications where data structures need to be distributed over the network. We have shown with a variety of datasets and similarity measures that the proposed method typically converges to above 90% recall with each point comparing only to several percent of the whole dataset on average
