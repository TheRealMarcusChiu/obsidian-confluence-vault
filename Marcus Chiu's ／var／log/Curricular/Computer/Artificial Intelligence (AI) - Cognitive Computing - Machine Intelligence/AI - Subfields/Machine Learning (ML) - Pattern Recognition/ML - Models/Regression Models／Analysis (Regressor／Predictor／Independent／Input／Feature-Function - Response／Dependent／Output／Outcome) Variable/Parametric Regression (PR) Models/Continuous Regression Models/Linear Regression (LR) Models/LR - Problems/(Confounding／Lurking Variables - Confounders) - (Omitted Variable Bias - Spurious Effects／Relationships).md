<strong>omitted variable bias</strong> occurs when a [[Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression|regression model]] leaves out relevant independent variables, which are known as <strong>confounding variables</strong>. This forces the model to attribute the effects of omitted variables to variables that are in the model, which biases the coefficient estimates
# Conditions that Cause Omitted Variable Bias
- the omitted variable 𝑍 must [[Correlation|correlate]] with the dependent variable 𝑌
- the omitted variable 𝑍 must correlate with at least one independent variable 𝑋 in the regression model
- that one independent variable 𝑋 must correlate with the dependent variable 𝑌

# Effects of Omitted Variable Bias

The effect of 𝑋 can be either:
- overestimated
- underestimated
- masked
- sign reversed

# How to Detect Omitted Variable Bias

We know that for omitted variable bias to exist, an independent variable must correlate with the residuals. Consequently, we can [[Residual Plot - Partial Residual Plot|plot the residuals]] by the variables in our model. If we see a relationship in the plot, rather than random scatter, it both tells us that there is a problem and points us towards the solution
