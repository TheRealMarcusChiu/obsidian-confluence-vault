###### Logistic (Logit) Regression Model
- is a [[ML - Generative／Joint vs Discriminative／Conditional Models|discriminative]]-typed [[ML - Experience Type (Supervised／Unsupervised／Semi-Supervised／Self-Supervised／Multi-Instance／Reinforcement Learning)|supervised]] classification algorithm that models the relationship between:
	- a single discrete/categorical response/dependent variable 𝑌 (for continuous/scalar use [[Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression|linear regression]])
	- one or more explanatory/predictor/covariate/independent variables {𝑋<sub>1</sub>, ..., 𝑋<sub>𝑘</sub>}. predictor variable types:
		- continuous/scalar/numerical predictor
		- discrete/categorical predictor - itself can be either bi/multi-[nominal or ordinal](http://confluence.marcuschiu.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=330786)
- unlike [[Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression|linear regression]] which outputs continuous number values, logistic regression transforms its output using the [[Logistic Function - Sigmoid Function (Standard Logistic Function)|logistic sigmoid function]] to return a [[Probability|probability]] value which can then be mapped to two or more discrete classes
