moving from [[Univariate／Single-Variable／Simple Linear Regression Models|Univariate/Single-Variable/Simple Linear Regression Models]] to [[Multivariate／Multiple Linear Regression Models|Multivariate/Multiple Linear Regression Models]] opens an almost unlimited opportunity for us to improve prediction by adding more and more predictor variables 𝑿 into our model. On the other hand, overfitting a model leads to a low prediction power. Moreover, it will often result in large variances 𝜎<sup>2</sup>(𝑏<sub>𝑖</sub>) and therefore, unstable regression estimates.

Then, how can we build a model with the right, optimal set of predictors ⊆𝑿 that will give us a good, accurate fit?
