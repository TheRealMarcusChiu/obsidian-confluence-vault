###### Count Regression Models
````excerpt
- takes an input vector 𝑥∊ℝ<sup>𝑛</sup> as input and predicts the value of a <strong>count </strong>𝑦∊ℝ as output
- a type of [[Parametric Regression (PR) Models|parametric regression model]] whose dependent variable is a count of items, events, results, or activities
- counts are nonnegative integers (0, 1, 2, etc.)
- count data with:
	- higher [[Arithmetic Mean - Average - Location - Expected Value - Expectation Operator|means]] tend to be [[Univariate Normal／Gaussian／Gauss／Laplace-Gauss﻿ Distribution／Model／Process (Bell Curve)|normally distributed]] and you can often use [[Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression|Linear Regression]]/[[Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)|OLS]]
	- smaller means can be [[Skewness|skewed]], and Linear Regression might have a hard time fitting these data. In these cases, we use count regression models
