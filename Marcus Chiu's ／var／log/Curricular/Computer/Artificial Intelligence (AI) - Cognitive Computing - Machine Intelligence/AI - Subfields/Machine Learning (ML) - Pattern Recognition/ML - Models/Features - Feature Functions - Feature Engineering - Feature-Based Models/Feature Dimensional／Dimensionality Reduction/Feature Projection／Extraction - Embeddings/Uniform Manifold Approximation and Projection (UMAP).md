# UMAP - Assumptions

The algorithm is founded on three assumptions about the data:
1. the data is [[Uniform Distribution|uniformly distributed]] on [[Riemannian Manifolds - Riemannian Spaces|Riemannian manifold]]
2. the [[Riemannian Metric - Riemannian Metric Tensor|Riemannian metric]] is locally constant (or can be approximated as such)
3. the manifold is locally connected

From these assumptions it is possible to model the manifold with a fuzzy topological structure. The embedding is found by searching for a low dimensional projection of the data that has the closest possible equivalent fuzzy topological structure.
