###### Ensemble Methods/Techniques
````excerpt
- are techniques that create multiple models and then combine them to produce improved results

# Ensemble - Steps
1. construction of a dictionary 𝐷 = {𝑇<sub>1</sub>(𝑋), 𝑇<sub>2</sub>(𝑋), ..., 𝑇<sub>𝑀</sub>(𝑋)} of basis elements (weak learners) 𝑇<sub>𝑖</sub>(𝑋)
2. fitting a model 𝑓(𝑋) = 𝛴<sub>1≤𝑖≤𝑚</sub>\[𝛼<sub>𝑖</sub>·𝑇<sub>𝑖</sub>(𝑋)\]
