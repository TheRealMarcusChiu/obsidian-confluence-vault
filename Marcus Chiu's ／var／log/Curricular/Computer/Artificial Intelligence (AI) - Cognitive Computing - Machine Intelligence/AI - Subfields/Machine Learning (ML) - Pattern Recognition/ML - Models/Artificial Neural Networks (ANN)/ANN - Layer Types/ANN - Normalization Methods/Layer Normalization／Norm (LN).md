###### Layer Normalization/Norm (LN)
````excerpt
- invented \~2016
- unlike [[Batch Normalization／Norm (BN)|batch normalization]], it does not impose any constraint on the size of a mini-batch and it can be used in the pure online regime with batch size 1
- it's often used in recurrent models where batch normalization performs poorly

# Equations
- $𝜇^l = \frac{1}{H} \sum_{i=1}^H a_i^l$
- $𝜎^l = \sqrt{\frac{1}{H} \sum_{i=1}^{H} (a_i^l - 𝜇^l)^2}$

where:
- 𝑙 denotes the layer number
- 𝑎<sup>𝑙</sup> denotes the vector inputs to the layer
- 𝐻 denotes the number of hidden units in layer 𝑙
