###### Positional Encoding Theory

- is a way to represent the location of an item in a sequence

# Positional Encoding - Types
```dataview
LIST
FROM ""
WHERE file.folder = this.file.folder + "/" + this.file.name
```

- in [[BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)|BERT]], positional encodings are themselves trainable vectors, so no sinusoidal function is used anymore
