# Max Pooling - Example
![[Max Pooling Layer (MP) - MaxPooling Layer/max-pooling.png|301]]

A very common form of max pooling is a layer with filters of size 2×2, applied with a stride of 2, which subsamples every depth slice in the input by 2 along both width and height, discarding 75% of the activations:
- $f_{X,Y}(S) = \max_{a,b=0}^1 S_{2X+a, 2Y+b}$

In this case, every max operation is over 4 numbers.
