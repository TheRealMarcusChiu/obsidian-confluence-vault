# Linux Kernel - Source Code

The <strong>Linux Kernel</strong> is usually stored in the <strong>/boot</strong> directory
###### Example Linux Kernel

example [[Ubuntu]] /boot directory

![[Linux Kernel - Kernel Images (vmlinux／vmlinuz／zImage／bzImage)/boot-directory-example.png|500]]

the kernel file, in Ubuntu, is stored in the /boot folder and is called vmlinuz-<em>version</em>

when virtual memory was developed for easier multitasking abilities, “vm” was put at the front of the file to show that the kernel supports virtual memory. For a while, the Linux kernel was called vmlinux, but the kernel grew too large to fit in the available boot memory so the kernel image was compressed and the ending x was changed to a z to show it was compressed with zlib [[Data Compression|compression]]. This same compression isn’t always used, often replaced with LZMA or BZIP2, and some kernels are simply called zImage.

version numbering will be in the format A.B.C.D where:
- A.B will probably be 4.4
- C will be version
- D indicates patches or fixes
