The minimum size of the kernel means that the amount of extra communication required by device drivers reduces the maximum data flow through the kernel but also decreases kernel response time to interrupts. Microkernels are typically found in real-time systems"

What you normally get is a stripped-down monolithic kernel that has the majority of device drivers removed but still all of the system services within the kernel space. The device drivers will be attached to the kernel as required when starting up or running. These kernels are typically found on desktops, your Windows, Mac, and Linux OS flavors"
