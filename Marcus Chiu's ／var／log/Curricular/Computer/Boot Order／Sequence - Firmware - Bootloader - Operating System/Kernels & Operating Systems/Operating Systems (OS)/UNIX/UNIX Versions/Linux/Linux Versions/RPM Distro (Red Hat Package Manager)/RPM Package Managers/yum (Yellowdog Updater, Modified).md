> Cheat sheet: [https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/attachments/rh_yum_cheatsheet_1214_jcs_print-1.pdf](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/attachments/rh_yum_cheatsheet_1214_jcs_print-1.pdf)

> Yum upgrade and yum update will perform update to the latest version of package, but:
> ```
> sudo yum update   # will preserve obsolete packages
> sudo yum upgrade  # will delete obsolete packages
> ```

> [!expand]- group
> The <code>yum groupinstall …</code> command installs a bundle of packages that are designated as a group so that you don't need to install a bunch of individual packages yourself to have all of the features. So <code>yum groupinstall "Engineering and Scientific”</code> would install a bunch of packages that someone decided should be used on engineering and scientific workstations.
>
> Install a bunch of packages deemed “Engineering and Scientific”:
> - 
>     ```
>     yum groupinstall "Engineering and Scientific"
>     ```
>
> Would upgrade those packages if necessary (and install any new ones)
> - 
>     ```
>     yum groupupdate "Engineering and Scientific"
>     ```
>
> Would remove all of them
> - 
>     ```
>     yum groupremove "Engineering and Scientific"
>     ```
>
> will list the possible groups
> - 
>     ```
>     yum grouplist
>     ```
>
> will show what packages are members of groupname (you will need "quotes" if there are spaces in the group name)
> - 
>     ```
>     yum groupinfo groupname
>     ```
