# HUD - Introduction

# HUD - Types
```dataview
LIST
FROM ""
WHERE file.folder = this.file.folder + "/" + this.file.name
```

- [[TMUX Status Bar]]

# HUD - Fetching Information

> [!expand-ui]- Current Date Time
> ```
> date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M' # print current date and time: yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM
> ```

> [!expand-ui]- Battery Level
> You could use the <code><font style="color: rgb(122,134,154);">acpi</font></code> tool.
>
> Or look into sys files
> ```
> /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/capacity   # contains a value from 0 to 100
> /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/status     # either "Charging" or "Discharging"
> ```
>
> We will then be able to output the battery level, and do some action, depending on the battery state. To get the info:
> ```
> BATC=/sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/capacity
> BATS=/sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/status
>
> # prepend percentage with a '+' if charging, '-' otherwise
> test "`cat $BATS`" = "Charging" && echo -n '+' || echo -n '-'
>
> # print out the content (forced myself to use `sed` :P)
> sed -n p $BATC
> ```

> [!expand-ui]- Sound Level
> This one is always a pain.. I will assume that you use ALSA as your sound system (because I have no idea how OSS or PulseAudio works).
>
> First, you need to know which channel your want to watch. Most of the time, 'Master' is a good choice. I personnally use alsamixer to navigate between the channels to see what they are related to. The alsa-utils packages (name may vary depending on the distribution) contains a utility named amixer to interact with the system. The special command amixer get \<CONTROL\> is used to query informations about a channel. But the output is awful to look at, so we'll need to format it. Example output:
> ```
> ───── amixer get Master
> Simple mixer control 'Master',0
> Capabilities: pvolume pvolume-joined pswitch pswitch-joined
> Playback channels: Mono
> Limits: Playback 0 - 64
> Mono: Playback 53 [84%] [-10.00dB] [on]
> ```
>
> You can notice that the info we're interested in sits at the end of the output. That will make things easier.
> ```
> # parse amixer output to get ONLY the level. Will output "84%"
> # we need `uniq` because on some hardware, The master is listed twice in
> # "Front Left" and Front Right" (because laptop speakers I guess)
> amixer get Master | sed -n 's/^.*\[\([0-9]\+\)%.*$/\1/p'| uniq
> ```

> [!expand-ui]- CPU Load
> There are many way to get the current CPU load. iostat is one of them, and as it's easy to parse its output, i'll go with a trickier approach, using ps and bc.
>
> To get the current CPU load used by every program, one can use this command:
> ```
> # gives you the CPU load used by every running program
> # 'args' is used here just so you can see the programs command lines
>
> ps -eo pcpu,args
> ```
>
> We don't care about idling programs that uses '0.0' load or the header '%CPU', so we can just remove them with <code>grep -vE '^\\s\*(0.0|%CPU)'</code>.
> ```
> ps -eo pcpu | grep -vE '^\s*(0.0|%CPU)'
> ```
>
> We now have a list of the CPU loads actually used, but per program. We just need to sum them up!
> The problem is: bash <em>CAN'T</em> perform floating point operations. And thus, we will need the help of the great <code>bc</code> to do so (if you don't have this installed, I recommend that you just get it right away!).
>
> <code>bc</code> takes operations from stdin, and outputs to stdout. Pretty simple. Pretty good. Thanks to [randomcrocodile](http://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/220diq/howto_create_an_informative_status_bar_for_your/cgi9hve) for pointing out the two digit problem (and other things)
> ```
> # use the "here-line" feature.
> # The whole line goes to bc which outputs the result
>
> LINE=`ps -eo pcpu |grep -vE '^\s*(0.0|%CPU)' |sed -n '1h;$!H;$g;s/\n/ +/gp'`
> bc <<< $LINE
> ```
>
> <strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>verkgw</em> on [irc.blinkenshell.org](http://irc.blinkenshell.org) proposed a faster <code>awk</code> alternative. I don't know awk enough to come up with this kind of line, so I'll just continue with <code>grep</code> and <code>sed</code>. See the comparison [here](http://i.imgur.com/Aefbl8U.png)
> ```
> ps -eo pcpu | awk 'BEGIN {sum=0.0f} {sum+=$1} END {print sum}'
> ```

> [!expand-ui]- RAM Usage
> To display RAM usage (percentage of RAM actually by the system), we will use another place of the filesystem: <code>/proc</code>. This will be easier to find memory usage here, than battery level in <code>/sys</code>:
> ```
> ───── ls /proc/ | grep 'mem'
> iomem
> meminfo
> ```
>
> If you take a quick look at <code>iomem</code>, you'll understand that it's <strong>NOT</strong> the file we want here (I don't understand a bit of it)! Instead, let's take a look at meminfo:
> ```
> ───── sed 8q /proc/meminfo 
> MemTotal:        2748648 kB
> MemFree:         2209672 kB
> Buffers:           34016 kB
> Cached:           270728 kB
> SwapCached:            0 kB
> Active:           182292 kB
> Inactive:         272636 kB
> Active(anon):     150948 kB
> ```
>
> Good, good, exactly the information we want! So let's just extract them, using <code>awk</code> to fetch <em>ONLY</em> the column containing the value (Yeah, that's why I use awk for mostly. I'll need to dive a little more in that language):
> ```
> ───── grep -E 'Mem(Total|Free)' /proc/meminfo |awk '{print $2}'
> 2748648
> 2204288
> ```
>
> At this point, you might realise that those two number are not really useful. We will need to modify them a little by converting them to Mib, and making a ratio out of them. A neat alternative would be to ignore cached memory and buffers, to know exactly how much the applications are taking:
> ```
> # store the total and free memory in two variables
> read t f <<< `grep -E 'Mem(Total|Free)' /proc/meminfo |awk '{print $2}'`
> read b c <<< `grep -E '^(Buffers|Cached)' /proc/meminfo |awk '{print $2}'`
>
> # then, calcultate the percentage of memory used
> bc <<< "100($t -$f -$c -$b) / $t"
> ```

> [!expand-ui]- Network Connection State
> Mmh, this one can be tricky! Ther are two cases here:
> - You have one interface
> - You have more than one interface
>
> The first one is quite simple: use your interface name directly, and skip the following section.
>
> Now what if you have, let's say two interfaces: ethernet, and wifi. Let's find out HOW to get the currently used.
> We will need two tools for that: <code>ip</code> (from <code>iproute2</code>) and <code>iwconfig</code> (from <code>wireless\_tools</code>). We will get the interfaces with <code>ip</code>, and recognize the wifi interface using <code>iwconfig</code>. Sounds easy huh ?
> ```
> # The following assumes you have 3 interfaces: loopback, ethernet, wifi
> read lo int1 int2 <<< `ip link | sed -n 's/^[0-9]: \(.*\):.*$/\1/p'`
>
> # iwconfig returns an error code if the interface tested has no wireless
> # extensions
> if iwconfig $int1 >/dev/null 2>&1; then
>     wifi=$int1
>     eth0=$int2
> else 
>     wifi=$int2
>     eth0=$int1
> fi
>
> # in case you have only one interface, just set it here:
> # int=eth0
>
> # this line will set the variable $int to $eth0 if it's up, and $wifi
> # otherwise. I assume that if ethernet is UP, then it has priority over
> # wifi. If you have a better idea, please share :)
> ip link show $eth0 | grep 'state UP' >/dev/null && int=$eth0 || int=$wifi
> ```
>
> This is now the time to see if network is up or not. For that, a simple <code>ping</code> would do the trick:
> ```
> # just output the interface name. Could obviously be done in the 'ping'
> # query
> echo -n "$int"
>
> # Send a single packet, to speed up the test. I use google's DNS 8.8.8.8,
> # but feel free to use any ip address you want. Be sure to put an IP, not a
> # domain name. You'll bypass the DNS resolution that can take some precious
> # miliseconds ;)
> ping -c 1 8.8.8.8 >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "connected" || echo "disconnected"
> ```

> [!expand-ui]- Window Manager Groups
> Aaah, the information that has the most way to be fetched! The problem with this, is that every window manager provide a different way to fetch the number of workspaces, and the current one. If you're lucky, and that your WM is [EWMH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWMH) compliant, <code>xprop</code> will be the way to go. For the others, you will need to find a proper way on your own. For exemple, to get the number of groups and the current group with ratpoison:
> ```
> echo "`ratpoison -c groups| cut -sd'*' -f1`/`ratpoison -c groups| wc -l`"
> ```
>
> Back to the topic, fetching current group out of all the groups. To make this a little more exiting, we will output something like "<code>==|=====</code>", '|' being the current desktop, '=' being the other desktops.
>
> The first step is to fetch the number of desktops, and the index of the current one. To do that, let's use <code>xprop</code>
> ```
> cur=`xprop -root _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP | awk '{print $3}'
> tot=`xprop -root _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS | awk '{print $3}'
> ```
>
> If that enough for you, you can obviously just output <code>\$cur/\$tot</code> ;)
> But now, the desktop indicator. To do that, there is two solutions:
> - cicle through all the groups and output either '=' or '|'
> - ouput the correct number of '|' before and after '|'
>
> I tried both versions, and <code>time</code> reports that they are they're <em>almost</em> the same:
> ```
> ───── time cicle.sh
> ==|=======
>
> real    0m0.025s
> user    0m0.013s
> system  0m0.000s
>
> ───── time fillup.sh
> ==|=======
>
> real    0m0.020s
> user    0m00m0.013s
> system  0m0.000s
> ```
>
> We will then use the 'fillup' one. To improve performances, we will first fill a variable with the 'group line', and then output it. It goes like this:
> ```
> # Desktop numbers start at 0. if you want desktop 2 to be in second place,
> # start counting from 1 instead of 0. But wou'll lose a group ;)
> for w in `seq 0 $((cur - 1))`; do line="${line}="; done
>
> # enough =, let's print the current desktop
> line="${line}|"
>
> # En then the other groups
> for w in `seq $((cur + 2)) $tot`; do line="${line}="; done
>
> # don't forget to print that line!
> echo $line
> ```

> [!expand-ui]- MPD's Current Playing Song
> After all that we did alredy, printing the current playing should bequite easy as:
> ```
> cur=`mpc current`
> test -n "$cur" && echo $cur || echo "- stopped -"
> ```
>
> Easy isn't it ? So let's add some difficulties to it. What if you have only 120 pixels to display that ?
> Aaaah trickyer isn't it ?
>
> Don't worry, I wrote a small tool for that: [skroll](http://git.z3bra.org/skroll/log.html). You can see it in action [here](http://pub.z3bra.org/monochromatic/img/2014-03-28-skroll.gif).
>
> So now, our output has just become:
> ```
> cur=`mpc current`
> test -n "$cur" && echo $cur |skroll -n 20 -d0.5 -r || echo "- stopped -"
> ```
>
> A small drawback with this approach: you can't put other infos in the same bar as a <code>skroll</code>ing output, because it uses a <code>\\n</code> or a <code>\\r</code> to print the output.
