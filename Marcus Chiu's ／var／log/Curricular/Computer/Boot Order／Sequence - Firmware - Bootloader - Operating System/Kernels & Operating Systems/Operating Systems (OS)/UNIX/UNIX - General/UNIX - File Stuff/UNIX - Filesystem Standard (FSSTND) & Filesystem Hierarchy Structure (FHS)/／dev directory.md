/dev directory
- contains the special device files for all the devices
- the device files are created during installation, and later with the <strong>/dev/MAKEDEV</strong> script. The <strong>/dev/MAKEDEV.local</strong> is a script written by the system administrator that creates local-only device files or links (i.e. those that are not part of the standard <strong>MAKEDEV</strong>, such as device files for some non-standard device driver)
