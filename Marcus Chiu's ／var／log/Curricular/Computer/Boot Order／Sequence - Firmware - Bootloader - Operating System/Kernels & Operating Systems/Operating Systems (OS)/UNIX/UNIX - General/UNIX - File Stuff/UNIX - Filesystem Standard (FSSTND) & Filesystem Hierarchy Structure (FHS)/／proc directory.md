The<strong> /proc directory</strong> is a strange beast. It doesn’t really exist, yet you can explore it. Its zero-length files are neither binary nor text, yet you can examine and display them. This special directory holds all the details about your [[Linux]] system, including its kernel, processes, and configuration parameters.

Under Linux, everything is managed as a file; even devices are accessed as files (in the /dev directory). Although you might think that “normal” files are either text or binary (or possibly device or pipe files), the <strong>/proc directory</strong> contains a stranger type: virtual files. These files are listed, but don’t actually exist on disk; the [[Operating Systems (OS)|operating system]] creates them on the fly if you try to read them.

Most virtual files always have a current timestamp, which indicates that they are constantly being kept up to date. The <strong>/proc directory</strong> itself is created every time you boot your box. You need to work as root to be able to examine the whole directory; some of the files (such as the process-related ones) are owned by the user who launched it. Although almost all the files are read-only, a few writable ones (notably in /proc/sys) allow you to change kernel parameters.
