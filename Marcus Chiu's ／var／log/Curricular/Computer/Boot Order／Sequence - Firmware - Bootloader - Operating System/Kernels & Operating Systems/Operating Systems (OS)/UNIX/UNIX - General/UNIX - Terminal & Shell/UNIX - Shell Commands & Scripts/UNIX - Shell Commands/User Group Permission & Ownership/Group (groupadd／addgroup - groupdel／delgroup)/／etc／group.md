1. <strong>group\_name</strong>: It is the name of group. If you run ls -l command, you will see this name printed in the group field
2. <strong>Password</strong>: Generally password is not used, hence it is empty/blank. It can store encrypted password. This is useful to implement privileged groups
3. <strong>Group ID (GID)</strong>: Each user must be assigned a group ID. You can see this number in your [[／etc／passwd - ／etc／shadow|/etc/passwd]] file
4. <strong>Group List</strong>: It is a list of usernames of users who are members of the group. The user names, must be separated by commas
