###### UNIX
````excerpt
- is a simple [[Operating Systems (OS)|operating system]], but it takes a genius to understand the simplicity
- originally Uniplexed Information and Computing Service (UNICS)
- was developed in AT&T’s Bell Labs back in the mid-to-late 1960’s
- had a single [[Disk (Format - Filesystems／File-Systems (FS))|file system]] that programs use to communicate with each other. This is why “everything is a file” on [[Linux]] – including hardware devices and special files that provide system information or other data. It’s also why only [[Windows]] has drive letters, which it inherited from DOS — on other operating systems, every file on the system is part of a single directory hierarchy.
