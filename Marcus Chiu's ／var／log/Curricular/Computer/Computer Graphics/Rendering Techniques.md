The closest object it intersects is what will be seen in the reflection\n- refraction rays traveling through transparent material work similarly, with the addition that a refractive ray could be entering or exiting a material\n- a shadow ray is traced toward each light. If any opaque object is found between the surface and the light, the surface is in shadow and the light does not illuminate it"

This is then the object the eye sees through that pixel. Using the material properties and the effect of the lights in the scene, this algorithm can determine the [shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shading) of this object. The simplifying assumption is made that if a surface faces a light, the light will reach that surface and not be blocked or in shadow. The shading of the surface is computed using traditional 3D computer graphics shading models"

In a subsequent pass, rays are traced from the eye into the scene to determine the visible surfaces, and the photon map is used to estimate the illumination at the visible surface points. The advantage of photon mapping versus bidirectional path tracing is the ability to achieve significant reuse of photons, reducing computation, at the cost of statistical bias"
