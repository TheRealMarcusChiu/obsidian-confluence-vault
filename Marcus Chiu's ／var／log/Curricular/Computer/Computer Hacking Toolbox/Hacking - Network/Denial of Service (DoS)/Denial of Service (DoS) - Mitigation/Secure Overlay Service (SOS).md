<strong>Secure Overlay Service (SOS)</strong> protects a victim/target from [[Denial of Service (DoS)|DoS]] attacks while letting legitimate ([[Authentication (AuthN)|authenticated]]) users through

![[Secure Overlay Service (SOS)/secure-overlay-services.pdf]]
### High-Level Approach of SOS
- filter around the target
- allow “hidden” proxies to pass through the filter
- use network overlays to allow legitimate users to reach the “hidden” proxies
