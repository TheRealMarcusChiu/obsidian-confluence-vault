# Installation

> [!expand]- ubuntu
> sudo apt install aircrack-ng

> [!expand]- linux
> [https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=install_aircrack](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=install_aircrack)
>
> Aircrack-ng is a complete suite of tools to assess WiFi network security.
>
> It focuses on different areas of WiFi security:
> - Monitoring: Packet capture and export of data to text files for further processing by third party tools.
> - Attacking: Replay attacks, deauthentication, fake access points and others via packet injection.
> - Testing: Checking WiFi cards and driver capabilities (capture and injection)
> - Cracking: WEP and WPA PSK (WPA 1 and 2)
>
> 1. first we need /sys/class/ieee80211, if you don’t have it:
> 	- go to [http://linuxwireless.org/download/compat-wireless-2.6/](http://linuxwireless.org/download/compat-wireless-2.6/)
> 	- search for compat-wireless-2010-06-26-pc.tar or anything of the like
> 	- extract it
> 	- go into the folder where the MakeFile is located
> 	- type these commands: make unload make load
> 2. first we need to set our Network as monitor mode (default: promiscuous mode) ifconfig down iwconfig mode monitor ifconfig up
> 	- Mac’s builtin NIC doesn’t support monitor mode
> 	- follow \_setup\_mac.txt for monitor mode workaround
> 	- currently, aircrack-ng has limited support for Mac
> 3. install/update aircrack-ng on mac using brew on terminal brew install aircrack-ng
> 4. verify air stuff has been install type air in terminal then press TAB twice
>    
>    it should display something like this
>

> [!expand]- macOS
> Work around for \_setup.txt’s set Network to monitor mode in Mac
>
> Create symlink to airport
> ```
> sudo ln -s /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /usr/local/bin/airport
> ```
>
> To search for active channels nearby that you can sniff, run this:
> ```
> sudo airport en1 -s
> ```
>
> Example of sniffing in monitor mode
> ```
> sudo airport en1 sniff 1
> ```
>
> This sniffs on channel 1 and saves a pcap capture file to /tmp/airportSniffXXXXXX.pcap (where XXXXXX will vary)
>
> You can view this with:
> ```
> tcpdump -r <filename>
> opening it in wireshark
> ```
>
> The aircrack-ng suite has limited Mac OS X support. Currently it only supports the following tools: aircrack-ng, packetforge-ng, ivstools and makeivs. Any program which requires opening a wireless interface is not supported.
