# Installation
```
sudo apt install airgraph-ng
```
# Creating graphs

Now that you've got your nifty new program installed, it's time to run some [[airodump-ng]] CSV files through it so you can see the graphs this program creates. So you have airodump-ng .txt/.csv files to run through airgraph-ng go to your favorite terminal and cd into the directory where you're keeping them.

For example:
```
airodump-ng -w my-output wlan0 
```

The following creates a Client to Access point Relationship Graph
```
airgraph-ng -i demo.csv -o demo.png -g CAPR
```

The following creates a Client to Probe Request Graph
```
airgraph-ng -i demo.csv -o demo.png -g CPG
```

The graph size and the time to generate it depend on the size of your CSV file. So, the more APs and Clients you get with airodump-ng the bigger the graph it will be.
