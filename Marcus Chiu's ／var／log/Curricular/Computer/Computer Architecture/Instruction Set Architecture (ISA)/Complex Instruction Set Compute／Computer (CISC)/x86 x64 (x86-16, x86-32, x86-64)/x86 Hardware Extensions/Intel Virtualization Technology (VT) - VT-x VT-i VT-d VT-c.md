# Intel Virtualization Technology (VT)

> [!expand-ui]- VT-x : Virtualization Technology for IA-32 and Intel 64 Processors
> <strong>Intel VT-x</strong> (previously known as <strong>Intel VT</strong>) is the implementation of an Intel [Secure Virtual Machine](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Virtual_Machine) for the x86 [IA-32](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/IA-32) and [Intel 64](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_64) architectures. The older designation, “Intel VT” (without the “x”), continues to be used by many BIOS menus.
>
> VT-x is necessary for Intel systems in order to:
> - run domUs under Xen Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM) (as well as run a guest system under Windows)
> - run 64-bit guest systems under VMware
> - to run virtualization with KVM

> [!expand-ui]- VT-i : Virtualization Technology for Itanium Processors
> <strong>Intel VT-i</strong> is the implementation of an Intel [Secure Virtual Machine](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Virtual_Machine) for the [IA-64](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/IA-64) architecture (Itanium).

> [!expand-ui]- VT-d : Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O
> <strong>Intel VT-d</strong> makes direct access to a PCI device possible for guest systems with the help of the Input/Output Memory Management Unit ([IOMMU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOMMU)) provided. This allows a LAN card to be dedicated to a guest system, which makes attainment of increased network performance beyond that of an emulated LAN card possible. Of course, once such a direct access system has been implemented, live migration of the guest system is no longer possible. VMware can be configured for use with an activated Intel VT-d system using [VMware VMDirectPath for direct access to PCI cards](https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wikiEN/index.php?title=VMware_VMDirectPath_for_direct_access_to_PCI_cards&action=edit&redlink=1).
>
> Prerequisites for Intel VT-d
> - The chip set as well as the BIOS used must support Intel VT-d.
> 	- Requires the Intel Nehalem or later micro-architecture, such as that found in Xeon 34xx, 55xx and more recent, as well as other, desktop CPUs (see [A List of Intel CPUs](https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wikiEN/index.php?title=A_List_of_Intel_CPUs&action=edit&redlink=1)).
> 	- There are no special requirements placed on the CPUs themselves, since VT-d is a function of the chip set. The CPU need merely support VT in general.
>
> Information regarding the activation of Intel VT-d at the BIOS level (if supported by the Intel processor) can be found in the article, [Activating the Intel VT-d Virtualization Feature](https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/Activating_the_Intel_VT-d_Virtualization_Feature).
