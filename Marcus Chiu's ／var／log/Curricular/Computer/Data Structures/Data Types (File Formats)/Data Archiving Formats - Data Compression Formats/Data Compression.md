# Types of Compression
- <strong>lossless compression</strong> - guarantees data received is exactly the same as data sent
- <strong>lossy compression</strong> - does not guarantee data received is exactly the same as data sent

In this example, the range of differences, 0–3, can be represented with 2 bits each, rather than the 7 or 8 bits required by the full character. As soon as the difference becomes too large, a new reference symbol is selected\n- works better than RLE for most digital imagery, because adjacent pixels are usually similar"
