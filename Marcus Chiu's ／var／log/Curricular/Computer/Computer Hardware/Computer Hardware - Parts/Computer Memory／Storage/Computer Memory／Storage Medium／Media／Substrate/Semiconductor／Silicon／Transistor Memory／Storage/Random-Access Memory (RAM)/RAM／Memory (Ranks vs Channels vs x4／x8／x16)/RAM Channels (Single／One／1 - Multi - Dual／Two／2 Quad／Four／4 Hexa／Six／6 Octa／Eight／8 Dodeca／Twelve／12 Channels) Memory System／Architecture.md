###### RAM Channels (Single/One/1 - Multi - Dual/Two/2 Quad/Four/4 Hexa/Six/6 Octa/Eight/8 Dodeca/Twelve/12 Channels) Memory System/Architecture

- not the same as [[RAM (1S／2S Single／Double Sided Module - Single／1R - Dual／2R - Quad／4R - Octo／8R) Multi Ranks - Memory Rank|rank]]
- more channels means increased data transfer rate between [[Primary／Main／Physical Computer Memory／Storage|main memory]] and [[Memory Controller - Memory Chip Controller (MCC) - Memory Controller Unit (MCU)|memory controller]]

# RAM Channels

More channels mean:
- ✅ <strong>Higher bandwidth</strong> (more data at once)
- ✅ <strong>Better performance</strong> in memory-intensive tasks (rendering, simulation, servers)
- ⚠️ <strong>Same latency</strong>, because latency depends mostly on memory speed/timings, not the number of channels

For example, if one DDR5-4800 stick has \~38 GB/s bandwidth:
- Single-channel → 38 GB/s
- Dual-channel → 76 GB/s
- Quad-channel → 152 GB/s
- Hexa-channel → 228 GB/s
- Octa-channel → 304 GB/s
- Dodeca-channel → 456 GB/s

<em>(Roughly speaking — depends on CPU and memory configuration)</em>
