# IMC - History
Most modern desktop or workstation microprocessors use an <strong>integrated memory controller</strong> (<strong>IMC</strong>), including microprocessors from [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], [[Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)|AMD]], and those built around the [[ARM (Advanced RISC Machine - Acorn RISC Machine)|ARM architecture]].
- Prior to [K8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_K8) (circa 2003), [[AMD Processors／CPUs|AMD microprocessors]] had a memory controller implemented on their motherboard's [northbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northbridge_(computing)). In K8 and later, AMD employed an integrated memory controller.
- Likewise, until [Nehalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehalem_(microarchitecture)) (circa 2008), [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel) microprocessors used memory controllers implemented on the motherboard's northbridge. Nehalem and later switched to an integrated memory controller.
- Other examples of microprocessor architectures that use <em>integrated memory controllers</em> include [NVIDIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVIDIA)'s [Fermi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_(microarchitecture)), [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM)'s [POWER5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POWER5), and [Sun Microsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems)'s [UltraSPARC T1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UltraSPARC_T1).

# IMC - Downsides
While an integrated memory controller has the potential to increase the system's performance, such as by reducing memory latency, it locks the microprocessor to a specific type (or types) of memory, forcing a redesign in order to support newer memory technologies.
