###### Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)
````excerpt
- is a data <em>storage virtualization</em> technology that combines multiple physical [[Secondary／Virtual Memory (Drive)|disk drive]] components into one or more logical units for the purposes of data redundancy, performance improvement, or both
- a [[RAID Controllers／Cards|RAID card]] is used to combine multiple physical drives

# RAID Configurations

RAID Configurations depend on the [[Motherboard (MoBo)|motherboard]] whether it supports them
