###### Master Partition Table
- resides in the [[Master Boot Record (MBR)]]
- is a 64 byte structure made up of 4x16 byte partition entries
- the fixed size of the partition table limits the [[Operating Systems (OS)|OS]] to 4 partitions, but modern OS have built in the capability for many more partitions through a concept called extended partitions

Master Partition Table is the last 64 bytes of the MBR
