- when NTFS encounters files with long runs of zeros, the system counts how many zeros are present in the MFT header attribute
- the counter is stored instead of the actual data
- long runs of zeros are common on disks, so counting them is an easy way to compress a file
- the counting mechanism kicks in when the run of zeros consumes an entire cluster
- the resulting "sparseness" of the file is annotated in the data run that maps the clusters allocated to the file
