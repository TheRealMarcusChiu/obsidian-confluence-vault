###### Network Booting (NetBoot)
````excerpt
- is the process of booting, installing, and deploying an [[Operating Systems (OS)|operating system]] from a network rather than a [[Secondary／Virtual Memory (Drive)|local drive]]
````
^excerpt

# Typical Process

The initial software to be run is loaded from a server on the network; for [[Internet Protocol (IP)|IP]] networks this is usually done using the [[Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)]]. The server from which to load the initial software is usually found by broadcasting a Bootstrap Protocol or [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)|Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)]] request. Typically, this initial software is not a full image of the operating system to be loaded, but a small network boot manager program such as PXELINUX which can deploy a boot options menu and then load the full image by invoking the corresponding second-stage [[Boot Order／Sequence - Firmware - Bootloader - Operating System|bootloader]].
# Implementations
```dataview
LIST
FROM ""
WHERE file.folder = this.file.folder + "/" + this.file.name
```
