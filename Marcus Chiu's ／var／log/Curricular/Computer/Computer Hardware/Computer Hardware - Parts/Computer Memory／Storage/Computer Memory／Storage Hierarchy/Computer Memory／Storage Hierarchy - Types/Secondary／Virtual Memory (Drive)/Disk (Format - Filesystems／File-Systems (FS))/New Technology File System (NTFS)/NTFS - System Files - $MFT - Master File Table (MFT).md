###### Master File Table (MFT)
````excerpt
- is a database-like structured file internally named <code><font style="color: rgb(122,134,154);">\$MFT</font></code>
- contains a [[NTFS - MFT File Record／Entry|MFT record]] for every file and folder in the NTFS volume
- first 16 MFT records are reserved for NTFS metadata (i.e. [[NTFS - System／Meta Files|NTFS System Files]])
- when number of files grows, the size of the MFT increases
- when a file is deleted, the <code><font style="color: rgb(122,134,154);">\$MFT</font></code> entry is marked free (to be reused by a new file in the future)
