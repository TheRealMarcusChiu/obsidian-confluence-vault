###### Look-Up/Lookup Tables (LUT)
````excerpt
- an n-bit/input LUT can encode any n-input Boolean function by storing the truth table of the function in the LUT
- can be implemented with a [[Multiplexer (MUX)|multiplexer]] whose select lines are driven by the address signal and whose inputs are the values of the elements contained in the array. These values can either be:
	- hard-wired, as in an [[Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)|ASIC]] whose purpose is specific to a function
	- provided by [[D Latch - Gated D Latch - Transparent Latch|D latches]] which allow for configurable values
- is a key component of modern [[Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)|FPGAs]] that provide reconfigurable hardware logic capabilities

# LUT - Use Cases
- used in a [[Basic Logic Element (BLE)]] which is used in a [[Configurable Logic Block (CLB) - Logic Array Block (LAB)]]
