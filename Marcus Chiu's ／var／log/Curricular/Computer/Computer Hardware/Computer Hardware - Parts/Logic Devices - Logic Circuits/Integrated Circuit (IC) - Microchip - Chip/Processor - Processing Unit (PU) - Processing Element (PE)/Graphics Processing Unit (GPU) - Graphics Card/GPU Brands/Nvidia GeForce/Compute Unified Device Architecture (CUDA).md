###### Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA)
````excerpt
- is a [[Parallel - Algorithms／Computing／Programming／Systems|parallel computing]] platform and API that allows the software to use certain types of [[Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) - Graphics Card|graphics processing units (GPUs)]] for general-purpose processing, an approach called general-purpose computing on GPUs (GPGPU)
- is a software layer that gives direct access to the GPU's virtual instruction set and parallel computational elements, for the execution of compute kernels
- one of [[Nvidia]]'s proprietary technologies

# CPU Core vs CUDA Core

A single CUDA core is analogous to a CPU core, with the primary difference being that it is less sophisticated but implemented in much greater numbers. A common gaming CPU has anywhere between 2 and 16 cores, but CUDA cores number in the hundreds, even in the lowliest of modern Nvidia GPUs. Meanwhile, high-end cards now have thousands of them
