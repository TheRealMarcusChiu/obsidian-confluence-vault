For new builds with high-end GPUs, ATX 3.1 is the better choice, primarily for the more secure 12V-2x6 connector, which addresses melting issues seen with ATX 3.0's 12VHPWR connector. ATX 3.0 is still sufficient for most users, especially those with AMD/Intel GPUs or using a high-quality ATX 3.0 PSU, but ATX 3.1 is the safer, more future-proof option for the latest flagship GPUs

      "- Features the more secure 12V-2x6 connector, which has shorter sensing pins and longer conductors to prevent melting issues with high-power GPUs, say GameMax and Corsair.\n- Recommended for NVIDIA's 50-series GPUs and other high-end components, notes GameMax.\n- Slightly improved efficiency due to a shorter hold-up time (12ms vs 17ms)."

      "- Generally more expensive than ATX 3.0 units, though availability is increasing.\n- The internal 12VHPWR vs 12V-2x6 PCB header on the PSU side is the only difference; the cable itself is the same, though it is not recommended to mix them, says an ASUS ROG Forum post."
