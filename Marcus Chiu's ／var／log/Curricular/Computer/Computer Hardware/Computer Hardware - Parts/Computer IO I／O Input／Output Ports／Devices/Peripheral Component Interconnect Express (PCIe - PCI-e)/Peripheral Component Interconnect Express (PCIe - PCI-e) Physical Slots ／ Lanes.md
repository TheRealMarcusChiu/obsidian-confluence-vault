###### Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe - PCI-e) Physical Slots
````excerpt
- uses the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe - PCI-e) Specification／Interface|PCIe specification]]
- are expansion slots found on a computer's [[Motherboard (MoBo)|motherboard]]
- they allow additional hardware components to be connected to the computer, such as graphics cards, sound cards, network cards, and other peripherals

- consumer CPUs will typically allow for 16 to 24 PCIe lanes
- higher-end CPUs will typically allow for 64 or more PCIe lanes
