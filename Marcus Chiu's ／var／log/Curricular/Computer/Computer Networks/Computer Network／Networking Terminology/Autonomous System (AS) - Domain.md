###### Autonomous System (AS) or Domain
````excerpt
- is a collection of networks or subnets that are in the same administrative domain
````
^excerpt

# Autonomous System Number (ASN)
each AS is assigned an Autonomous System Number (ASN) a 16-bit integer by the <em>Internet Network Information Center (InterNIC)</em>

its 16-bit number are used in [[IPv4 - Multicast／Group／Class-D Addresses|IP GLOP addresses]]

ASNs were just 16-bit numbers, but are now 32-bit numbers (because the internet grew to the point of running out of the 65,536 or 2^16 initial allocation)
# Autonomous System & Network Protocols

each AS is composed of routers that have 2 goals:
- [[Routing Tables - Forwarding Tables|routing]] packets (building and maintaining routing tables) by utilizing [[Routing Protocols|routing protocols]]
- [[Routing Tables - Forwarding Tables|forwarding]] packets (sending packet to destination) by utilizing [[Routed Protocols|routed protocols]]

- [[Routing Protocols|routing protocols]] - are used to find all networks within and across multiple autonomous systems by updating and ensuring all routers have the same/correct <em>routing table</em>
	- 2 types of routing protocols: dynamic and static
		- static routing protocols - are rarely used
		- [[Dynamic Routing Protocols|dynamic routing protocols]] - have 2 types:
		- 
			- [[Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) or Intra-Domain Routing Protocols (IDRP)|IGP]] - routers communicating within an AS can run whatever [[Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) or Intra-Domain Routing Protocols (IDRP)|IGP]] (e.g. [[Distant Vector Protocols]] and/or [[Link-State Protocols]] protocols)
			- [[Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs) or Inter-Domain Routing Protocols (IDRP)|EGP]] - routers communicating across ASs must use the same [[Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs) or Inter-Domain Routing Protocols (IDRP)|EGP]] (e.g. [[Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)|Border Gateway Protocol]])
- [[Routed Protocols|routed protocols]] - with routing tables built by routing protocols, routers are able to determine the path to <em>forward</em> a packet within and between autonomous systems
