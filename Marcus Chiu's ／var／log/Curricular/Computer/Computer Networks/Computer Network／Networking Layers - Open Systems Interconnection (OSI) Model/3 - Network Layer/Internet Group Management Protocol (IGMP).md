###### Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)
- is a [[Computer Network／Networking Communication Protocols|network protocol]] that operates at the [[3 - Network Layer|network layer]]
- is a communications protocol used by hosts and adjacent routers on IPv4 networks to establish multicast group memberships
- is an integral part of IP multicast

Hosts “join” and “leave” multicast groups using IGMP

Routers create a delivery path through the Internet using routing protocols such as:
- PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast)
	- Helps build multicast forwarding trees
	- Routers maintain multicast states to remember which forwarding trees they are part of
- MSDP (Multicast Source Distribution Protocol)
