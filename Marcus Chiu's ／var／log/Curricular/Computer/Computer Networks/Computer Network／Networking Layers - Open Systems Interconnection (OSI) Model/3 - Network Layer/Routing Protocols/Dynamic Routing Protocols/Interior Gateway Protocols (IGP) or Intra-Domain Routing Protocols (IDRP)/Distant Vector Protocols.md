###### Distant Vector Protocols
````excerpt
- In <strong>distance vector protocols</strong>, each router sends its neighbors a list of all known networks along with its own distance to each one of these networks. Because in software engineering, a list (or better said, an array) is also called a vector, the list of networks and distances is sometimes called the vector of networks and distances, hence the name distance vector routing protocol

# Distant-Vector - How it Works

To understand what happens when a node detects a link failure, consider what happens when F detects that its link to G has failed:
1. first, F sets its new distance to G to infinity and passes that information along to A
2. since A knows that its 2-hop path to G is through F, A would also set its distance to G to infinity
3. however, with the next update from C, A would learn that C has a 2-hop path to G. Thus, A would know that it could reach G in 3 hops through C, which is less than infinity, and so A would update its table accordingly.
4. when A advertises this to F, node F would learn that it can reach G at a cost of 4 through A, which is less than infinity, and the system would again become stable
