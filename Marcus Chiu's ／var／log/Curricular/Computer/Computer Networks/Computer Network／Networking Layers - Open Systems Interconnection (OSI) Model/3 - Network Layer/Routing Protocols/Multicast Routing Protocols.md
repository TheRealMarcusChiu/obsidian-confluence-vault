###### Multicast Routing Protocols
````excerpt
- manages group membership and controls the path that multicast data takes over the network
- updates a multicast routing table (as unicast routing protocols update unicast routing tables)

^excerpt

# Multicast Reverse Path Forwarding (mRPF or just RPF) aka Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB)
- often used in tandem with multicast protocols
- the underlying assumptions of RPF check are that:
	- the <em>unicast routing table</em> must be correct and converged (i.e. up to date)
	- the path used from a sender to a router and the reverse path from the router back to the sender are symmetric
