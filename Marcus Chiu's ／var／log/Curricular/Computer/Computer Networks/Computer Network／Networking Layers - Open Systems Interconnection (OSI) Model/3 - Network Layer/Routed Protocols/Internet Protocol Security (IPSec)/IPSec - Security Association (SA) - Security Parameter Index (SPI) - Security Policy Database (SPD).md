### Security Association (SA)
- SA is a cryptographically protected connection (i.e. IPSec session)
- SA specifies the encryption/authentication algorithms, keys, parameters, etc
- SA identified by:
	- Security Parameter Index (SPI)
	- Destination [[IPv4 - Address|IP Address]]
	- Protocol Identifier ([[IPSec - Authentication Header (AH)|AH]] or [[IPSec - Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)|ESP]])
- security policy database - specifies what kind of protection should be applied to packets (acc. to source-destination address, port numbers, user ID, data sensitivity level, etc.)
- each SA entry contains:
- a database of SA entries are stored at the host/router
- a single SA defines the IPSec communication between a 2 hosts/routers, therefore 2 copies are stored (one for each host/router)
