###### S<strong>ymmetric NAT</strong>
- applies restrictions exactly the same way as an [[Address Port Restricted Cone NAT]] but handles the NAT translation differently
- all types of NAT discussed so far don’t change the source port when NATing connections. For example, when a client accesses the Internet using IP 192.168.0.1 and source port 56723 NAT changes the source IP to say 56.35.67.35 but keeps the port number the same; this is known as port preservation. A Symmetric NAT however randomly generated ones new ports
