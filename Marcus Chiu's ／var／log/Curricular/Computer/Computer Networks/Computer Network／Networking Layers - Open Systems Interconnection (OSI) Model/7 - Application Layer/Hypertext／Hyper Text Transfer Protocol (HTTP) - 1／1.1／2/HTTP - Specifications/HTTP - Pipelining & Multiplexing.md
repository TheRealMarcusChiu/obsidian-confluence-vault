### <strong>HTTP/1.1 With Pipelining</strong>

Each HTTP request over the TCP connection may be made immediately without waiting for the previous request's response to return. The responses will come back in the same order.
### <strong>HTTP/2 Multiplexing</strong>

Each HTTP request over the TCP connection may be made immediately without waiting for the previous response to come back. The responses may come back in any order.
