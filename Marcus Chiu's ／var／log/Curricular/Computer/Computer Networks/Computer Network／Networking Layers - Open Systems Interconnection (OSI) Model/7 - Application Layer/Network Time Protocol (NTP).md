# NTP - Introduction

A computer that needs to synchronize its time will use the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which relies on [[Universal／User Datagram Protocol (UDP)|UDP]] port 123 for communication. The computer (NTP client) sends a time-request packet to the NTP server, which then responds with its current time and timestamps of its own. The client uses these timestamps and [Marzullo's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marzullo%27s_algorithm) (or a variant) to calculate network delay and clock offset, then adjusts its local clock to match the server's time.
