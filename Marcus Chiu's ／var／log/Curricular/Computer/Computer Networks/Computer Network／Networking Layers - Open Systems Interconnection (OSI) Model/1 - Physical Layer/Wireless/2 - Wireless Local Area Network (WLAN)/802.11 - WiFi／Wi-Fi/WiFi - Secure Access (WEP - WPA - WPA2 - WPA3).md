# Secure Access Ranking

list ranking the current Wi-Fi security methods available on any modern (post-2006) router, ordered from best to worst:
- WPA3
- WPA2 + [[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)|AES]]
- WPA + AES
- WPA + TKIP/AES (TKIP is there as a fallback method)
- WPA + TKIP
- WEP
- WPS
- Open Network (no security at all)
