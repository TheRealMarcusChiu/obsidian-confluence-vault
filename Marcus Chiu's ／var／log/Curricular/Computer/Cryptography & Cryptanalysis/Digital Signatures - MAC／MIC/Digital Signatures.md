###### Digital Signatures
````excerpt
- a <em>digital signature</em> of a message (which is produced by the signer) gives a recipient very strong reason to ensure:
	- message authentication - message originated from the stated signer
	- message integrity - message has not been changed

# Digital Signature Attacks and Forgeries
###### Digital Signature Attacks
- <strong>key-only attack</strong> - attacker knows sender's public key
- <strong>known message attack</strong> - attacker has access to set of messages and their corresponding signatures
- <strong>generic chosen message attack</strong> - attacker choose a list of messages independent of sender's public key)
- <strong>directed chosen message attack</strong> - attacker choose a list of messages dependent on sender's public key before signatures are seen

###### Digital Signature Forgeries
- <strong>total break</strong> - attacker determines senders private key
- <strong>universal forgery</strong> - attacker efficiently finds a way to sign arbitrary messages
- <strong>selective forgery</strong> - attacker forges signature for a chosen message
- <strong>existential forgery</strong> - attacker forges signature for at least 1 message. attacker has no control over message
