- internet checksum idea:
	- data is separated into a sequence of 16-bit integers
	- the 16-bit integers are added together using 16-bit ones complement arithmetic
	- then take the ones complement of result
	- that 16-bit number is the [[Error Detection - Checksum|checksum]]
- not as good at detecting errors than CRC, but is used because it is easier to implement than CRC
  
  ignore the white 1s
