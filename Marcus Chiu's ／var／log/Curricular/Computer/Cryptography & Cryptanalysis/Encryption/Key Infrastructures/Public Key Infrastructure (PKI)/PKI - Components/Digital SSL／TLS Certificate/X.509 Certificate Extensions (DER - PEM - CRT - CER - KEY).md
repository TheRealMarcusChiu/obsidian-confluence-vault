# X.509 File Extensions
###### Encodings (also used as extensions):
- <strong>.PEM</strong> - the extension is used to denote that the certificate is encoded in [[ASCII]] ([[Base64 Notation]]). There are various types of X.509v3 files and they are (usually) prefixed with a "<code><font style="color: rgb(122,134,154);">-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----</font></code>" line and suffixed with a "<code><font style="color: rgb(122,134,154);">-----END CERTIFICATE-----</font></code>"
  <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----</code><br><code>... base 64 encoding of the DER encoded certificate</code><br><code>    with line endings and padding with equals signs ...</code><br><code>-----END CERTIFICATE-----</code></span>

- <strong>.DER</strong> - the extension is used to denote that the certificate is encoded in binary. These files may also bear the CER or CRT extension. Proper English usage would be "I have a DER encoded certificate" not "I have a DER certificate"

###### Extensions:
- <strong>.CRT</strong> - extension used for certificates. may be encoded in binary or ASCII (\*NIX Convention)
- <strong>.CER</strong> - similar to .CRT (Microsoft Convention)
- <strong>.KEY</strong> - extension used both for public and provide PKCS\#8 keys. may be encoded in binary or ASCII

the only time CRT and CER can be interchanged is when the encoding type can be identical (i.e. ASCII encoded CRT = ASCII encoded CER)
