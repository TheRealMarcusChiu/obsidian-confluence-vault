````excerpt
- is a [[Trusted Intermediaries (TI) - Trusted Third Party (TTP)|Trusted Intermediary]] that:
	- holds a [[Asymmetric／Two／Public-Private Key Function|public-private key]] pair
	- uses its own [[Asymmetric／Two／Public-Private Key Function|private-key]] to issue/sign a:
		- [Certificate Signing Request (CSR)](http://confluence.marcuschiu.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2655255) which then becomes a [[Digital SSL／TLS Certificate|Digital SSL/TLS Certificate]]
		- [[Certificate Revocation List (CRL)]]
- to verify whether a [[Certificate Signing Request (CSR)|CSR]] or [[Certificate Revocation List (CRL)|CRL]] was signed by a CA, we use the CA's [[Asymmetric／Two／Public-Private Key Function|public-key]]. [[Certificate Authority (CA) - Where Are The List of CAs Stored？|All trusted CA public-keys come pre-package in the operating system]]
