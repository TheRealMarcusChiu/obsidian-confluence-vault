###### Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
- a [[Key Infrastructures|Key Infrastructure]] similar to the [[Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)]]
- used for securing [[Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)|BGP]] updates (one of several [[BGP - Secure Variants|other ways]])
- secures the route origin (associating a route with an originating [[Autonomous System (AS) - Domain|AS number]])
- doesn't secure the [[Autonomous System (AS) - Domain|autonomous system]] path

# RPKI Pros and Challenges
pros:
- offline crypto to verify ROA chains
- use a whitelist to filter hijacked BGP routes
- more effective than prefix filtering
	- prefix filtering is on customer prefixes, RPKI is on neighbors
- more incentives to avoid prefixes being hijacked

challenges:
- can be misconfigured
- partial deployment of ROV-related issues
- can be circumvented
	- route leaks
	- path alteration/shortening attacks

# RPKI Deployment Challenges
###### ASPATH Manipulation
- ASPATH = Autonomous System Path
- ASPATH manipulation more difficult to succeed
	- the attacker's (AS 666) ASPATH likely to be longer than the authentic (AS A) ASPATH, and therefore AS X would direct all data through the authentic ASPATH

###### Loose ROA problem

# Impact of Partial ROV Adoption
- <strong>collateral benefit</strong> - adopters of ROV protect [[Autonomous System (AS) - Domain|autonomous systems]] (that do not adopt ROV) behind them by discarding invalid routes
- <strong>collateral damage</strong> - autonomous systems not doing ROV might cause autonomous systems that do ROV to fall victim to attacks
	- <strong>disconnection</strong> - adopters of ROV might be offered only bad routes
	- <strong>control-plane-data-plane mismatch</strong> - data flows to the attacker, although AS 3 discarded it
