````excerpt
- is a [[Symmetric／Single／Secret Key Function|symmetric]] stream cipher [[Encryption - Algorithms|encryption algorithm]]
- developed by Daniel J. Bernstein
- known for its simple ARX (Addition-Rotation-XOR) operations, making it suitable for hardware and software implementation, especially on mobile devices and systems without [[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)|AES]] acceleration
- it is commonly used with [[Poly1305]] as an authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) algorithm, providing both confidentiality and data integrity
- is widely adopted in protocols like [[Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) - Transport Layer Security (TLS)|TLS]] 1.3, [[WireGuard]], and OpenSSH
