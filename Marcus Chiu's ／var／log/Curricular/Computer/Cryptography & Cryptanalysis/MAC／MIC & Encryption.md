# Orders of MAC & Encryption
- <strong>Encrypt-then-MAC</strong> is the most ideal scenario. Any modifications to the cipher-text that do not also have a valid MAC code can be filtered out before decryption, protecting against any attacks on the implementation. The MAC cannot, also, be used to infer anything about the plain-text
- <strong>MAC-then-Encrypt</strong> and <strong>Encrypt-and-MAC</strong> both provide different levels of security, but not the complete set provided by <strong>Encrypt-then-MAC</strong>
