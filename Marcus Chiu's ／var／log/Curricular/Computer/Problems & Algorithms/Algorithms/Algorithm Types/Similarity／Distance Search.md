###### Similarity/Distance Search
````excerpt
- is the most general term used for a range of mechanisms that share the principle of searching spaces of objects where the only available comparator is the [[Distance／Similarity／Divergence Measure／Metric／Semi-Metric／Functions - Norm／Semi-Norm|similarity/distance]] between any pair of objects
- used in [[Vector Database]]s for indexing methods
