<strong>Decision Problems</strong> and <strong>Optimization Problems</strong>
````excerpt
- both are types of a [[Computable／Computational Problems|computational problem]]
- <strong>decision problem</strong> is a problem that asks if a statement is true or false. The output of a decision problem is a single yes/no answer.
- <strong>optimization problem</strong> is a problem that asks to find the best solution from all feasible solutions. The output of an optimization problem is a solution that minimizes or maximizes an objective function
