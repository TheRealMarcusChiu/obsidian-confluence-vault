here's the website: [doc.marcuschiu.com](http://doc.marcuschiu.com/)

it began on March 18, 2018 the day after I quit work. I have been using it until March 2019. this is when I resorted in a third-party documentation system as you see here. I have been experimenting with mediawiki which is live here: [wiki.marcuschiu.com](http://wiki.marcuschiu.com). But confluence which runs the site here seemed more appropriate for my needs. This is due to the nature of subpages in which mediawiki does not support sufficiently.

### Subpages
```dataview
LIST
FROM ""
WHERE file.folder = this.file.folder + "/" + this.file.name
```
