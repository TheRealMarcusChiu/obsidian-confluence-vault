Whenever there are more <em>software</em> threads of execution trying to execute at any given time than there are available <em>hardware</em> (simultaneous) threads of execution, then these software threads will be "interleaved" among the available cores. In the case of a "uniprocessor" (one CPU core with no hyper-threading), if you have more than one software thread, they will <em>always</em> be interleaved. If you have a 4-core CPU with hyper-threading, that's 8 "hardware threads", meaning the CPU can execute 8 simultaneous threads of execution at the same instant, so if you had 8 software threads trying to run, they could all run at once; but if you had 9 software threads, one of the hardware threads would have to interleave a pair of threads (the exact pair of threads chosen would depend on the operating system's scheduler implementation).
# <strong>General Concepts</strong>
- <strong>synchronous</strong> - tasks are executed one after another, each task waits for any previous task to complete and then gets executed
- <strong>asynchronous</strong> - when one task gets executed, you could switch to a different task without waiting for the previous to get completed
	- <strong>asynchronous </strong><strong>with outside entity</strong> - the dispatching of task(s) to an outside entity, leaving the originating program free to execute other task(s) until it receives a signal from that entity (e.g. Ajax call). That signal can be either: task-finished or error
	- <strong>asynchronous without outside entity </strong>- similar to multi-tasking
- <strong>concurrency</strong> - multiple tasks (e.g. processes or threads) in execution, either: simultaneously or not
	- <strong><strong>parallel</strong> </strong>and<strong> distributed </strong>- multiple tasks in execution simultaneously. It achieves this by distributing tasks to multiple resources (e.g. processors, execution-units)
		- <strong>parallel</strong> - communicate over a shared memory
		- <strong>distributed</strong> - communicate over a network
	- <strong>multi-tasking</strong> - multiple tasks in execution but NOT simultaneously. There is only 1 resource that executes these tasks, therefore at any given moment only 1 task is actually executing code. However, multi-tasking emulates "parallelism" via context switching (i.e. execution time of tasks are interleaved with each other on a single resource)
