Mutex 'down' happens in one thread and mutex 'up' <em>must</em> happen in the same thread later on. e.g.: If you are deleting a node from a global linked list, you do not want another thread to muck around with pointers while you are deleting the node. When you acquire a mutex and are busy deleting a node, if another thread tries to acquire the same mutex, it will be put to sleep till you release the mutex"

# (Mutex) vs (Mutex Semaphore) vs (Binary Semaphore)

In a Mutex, only the thread which have locked it can unlock it. If any other thread comes to lock it, it will wait
- In a Binary Semaphore, it is OK for B to take the semaphore and A to give it. Again, a binary semaphore is NOT protecting a resource from access. The act of Giving and Taking a semaphore are fundamentally decoupled
- In a Mutex Semaphore is same as Mutex. It is a binary semaphore with the restriction that

```

NOTE: in case you've ever wondered at the bizarre letters used for claiming and releasing semaphores, it's because the inventor was Dutch. Probeer te verlagen:
- probeer - means to try and decrease
- verhogen - means to increase
