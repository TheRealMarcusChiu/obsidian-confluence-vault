# Feature Toggle Types

feature toggle categorization dimensions:
- longevity - how long the feature toggle will live
- dynamism - how dynamic the toggling decision must be
- who will manage the feature toggle

      "- are used to control operational aspects of systems' behavior\n- introduced when rolling out a new feature that has unclear performance implications so that the system operators can disable or degrade it in production if needed\n- relatively short-lived\n- however, it may be long-lived \"kill-switches\" that allows system operators to gracefully disable/degrade non-vital functionality when the system is enduring unusually high load (manually-managed Circuit Breaker)\n- purpose of these flags is to allow operators to quickly react to production issues they need to be re-configured extremely quickly - needing to roll out a new release in order to flip an Ops Toggle is unlikely to make an Operations person happy"
