A <strong>Git Workflow</strong> is a recipe or recommendation for how to use [[git (Global Information Tracker)|Git]] to accomplish work in a consistent and productive manner

Some things to consider when evaluating a Git workflow are:
- Does this workflow scale with team size?
- Is it easy to undo mistakes and errors with this workflow?
- Does this workflow impose any new unnecessary cognitive overhead to the team?

This encapsulation makes it easy for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main codebase. It also means the <code>master</code> branch should never contain broken code, which is a huge advantage for continuous integration environments"
