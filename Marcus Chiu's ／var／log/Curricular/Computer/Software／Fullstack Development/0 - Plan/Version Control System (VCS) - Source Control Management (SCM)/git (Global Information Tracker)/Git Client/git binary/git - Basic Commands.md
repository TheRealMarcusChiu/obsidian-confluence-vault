###### <strong>MANAGING BRANCHES</strong>

> [!expand]- Click here to expand...
> git branch
> - display all existing branches
>
> git branch branch-name
> - create a branch ‘experimental’
>
> git checkout branch-name
> - switch to another branch
>
> git checkout -b branch-name
> - creates and switch to branch
>
> git branch -d experimental
> - delete the branch
> - this ensures that changes in the experimental branch are already in the current branch

>
> git branch branch-name (sha1-commit)

###### <strong>MERGING BRANCHES AND MERGE CONFLICTS</strong>

> [!expand]- Click here to expand...
> git merge branch-name
> - merge changes made in branch-name into current branch you are on
> - If no merge conflicts, you’re done.
>
> git diff
> - show merge conflicts
>
> resolve the conflicts by editing files, then commit
> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>  git commit -a (does both ‘git add .’ and ‘git commit’ together)</code></span>
###### <strong>CHECKOUT REMOTE BRANCH THAT DOES NOT EXIST IN LOCAL REPO</strong>

> [!expand]- Click here to expand...
> two ways to actually do it
> 1. git fetch (remote) (rbranch):(lbranch)
>    
>    <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>git checkout \<lbranch\></code></span>
> 2. git checkout —b 17.2 track origin/17.2
> 	- create a new branch named ’17.2’ that tracks ‘origin/17.2’
> 	- MAY NOT WORK so do these steps:
> 		- you need to check your remotes:
> 		  
> 		  <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>git remote -v</code></span>
> 		- make sure origin is fetched:
> 		  
> 		  <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>git fetch origin</code></span>
> 		- see if you do have fetched an origin/master branch
> 		  
> 		  git branch -av
###### <strong>CHECKOUT A PULL-REQUEST FROM GITHUB</strong>

> [!expand]- Click here to expand...
> Fetch a remote PR into your local repo
> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>git fetch origin pull/\<pull request id\>/head:\<lbranch\></code><br><code>git checkout \<lbranch\></code></span>
###### <strong>UPDATING LOCAL REPO FROM REMOTE REPO</strong>

> [!expand]- Click here to expand...
> - If another person has pushed to the same branch as you, Git won’t be able to push your changes
> - you can fix this by ‘fetching and merging’ the changes made on the remote branch with what changes you made locally
>   
>   <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>git fetch origin                      (fetches updates made from an online repository)</code><br><code>git merge origin branch-name          (merges updates made online with branch-name local work)</code><br><code>git pull origin branch-name           (does both fetch and merge)</code><br><code>git pull origin branch-name —rebase   (pops off local commits, updates the local commit history from remote repo, then apply local commits)</code></span>
