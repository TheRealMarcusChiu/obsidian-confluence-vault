<strong>[[Continuous Integration (CI)]]</strong> - the practice where developers continuously integrate/merge their changes back to the main branch as often as possible. The changes are then validated by creating a build via [[2 - Build Tools／Systems|build-tools]] and running [[3 - Testing (Automated Tests)|automated tests]] against the build to check that the application is not broken whenever new commits are integrated into the main branch
