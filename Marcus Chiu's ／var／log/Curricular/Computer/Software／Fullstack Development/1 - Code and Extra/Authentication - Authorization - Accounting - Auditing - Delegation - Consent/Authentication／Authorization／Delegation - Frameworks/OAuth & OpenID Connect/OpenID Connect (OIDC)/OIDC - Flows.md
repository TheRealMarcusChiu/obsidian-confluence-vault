^excerpt

[[Open Authorization (OAuth)|OAuth]] Specification includes the definition of a Web API called “authorization endpoint”. The API requires <code>response\_type</code> as a mandatory request parameter. OpenID Connect has defined flows to issue ID tokens by extending the specification of the <code>response\_type</code> request parameter.

In [[Open Authorization (OAuth)|OAuth]], the value of <code>response\_type</code> is either <code>code</code> or <code>token</code>. OpenID Connect has added a new value, <code>id\_token</code>, and allowed any combination of <code>code</code>, <code>token</code> and <code>id\_token</code>. A special value, <code>none</code>, has been added, too. As a result, now <code>response\_type</code> can take any one of the following values
