<strong>Token-Based Authentication</strong>
- is a method that allows users to enter their username and password in order to obtain a token that allows them to make a specific request - without using their username and password. Once their token has been obtained, the user can offer the token - which offers access to a specific resource for a time period - to the remote site

# Access Token - Profile Types
- <strong>Holder of Key (HoK) Tokens </strong>- like a credit card, ensures that the Client presenting the token is the one it was issued to
- <strong>Bearer Tokens</strong> - like cash, do not ensure whether the Client presenting the token was actually issued it
