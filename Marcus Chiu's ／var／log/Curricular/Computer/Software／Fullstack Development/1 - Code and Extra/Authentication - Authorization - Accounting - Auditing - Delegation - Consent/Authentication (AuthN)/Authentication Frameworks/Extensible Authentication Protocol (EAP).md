### EAP Methods/Alternatives
###### EAP-TLS
- [[Authentication Protocols - Mutual／2-Way|mutual authentication]] using [[Asymmetric／Two／Public-Private Key Function|public key]] certificates between user and [[Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)|authentication server (RADIUS)]]
- establishes encrypted [[Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) - Transport Layer Security (TLS)|TLS]] session between the two

###### Protected EAP (PEAP)
- 2 stages
- [[Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)|RADIUS server]] authenticates itself using certificates
- user can use some other method available in EAP

###### Lightweight EAP (LEAP)
- Cisco proprietary EAP
- enables [[Authentication Factor - Password Based - Static Password／Passwords|password based authentication]] for user
