The new field is invisible to users. It's called \"uniqueifier\" and consists of four bytes\n\t- If the table does not have a clustered index (aka a heap table), the \"row locator\" is a RID or row identifier. The RID points to a physical location. It consists of the file identifier (ID), page number, and the number of the row on the page\n- one practical consequence of the \"row locator\" is that it makes sense to have a small [[Database Key Types (Candidate - Primary - Alternate - Unique - Composite／Compound／Concatenated／Federated - Super - Foreign) Key|primary key]] for a table with a lot of indexes"

# Clustered vs Non-Clustered - Analogy

> ###### CLUSTERED INDEX
>
> If you walk into a public library, you will find that the books are all arranged in a particular order (most likely the Dewey Decimal System, or DDS). This corresponds to the <em>"clustered index"</em> of the books. If the DDS\# for the book you want was <code>005.7565 F736s</code>, you would start by locating the row of bookshelves that is labeled <code>001-099</code> or something like that. (This endcap sign at the end of the stack corresponds to an "intermediate node" in the index.) Eventually you would drill down to the specific shelf labelled <code>005.7450 - 005.7600</code>, then you would scan until you found the book with the specified DDS\#, and at that point <em>you have found your book.</em>
> ###### NON-CLUSTERED INDEX
>
> But if you didn't come into the library with the DDS\# of your book memorized, then you would need a second index to assist you. In the olden days you would find at the front of the library a wonderful bureau of drawers known as the "Card Catalog". In it were thousands of 3x5 cards -- one for each book, sorted in alphabetical order (by title, perhaps). This corresponds to the <em>"non-clustered index"</em>. These card catalogs were organized in a hierarchical structure, so that each drawer would be labeled with the range of cards it contained (<code>Ka - Kl</code>, for example; i.e., the "intermediate node"). Once again, you would drill in until you found your book, but in <em>this</em> case, once you have found it (i.e, the "leaf node"), you don't have the book itself, but just a card with an <em>index</em> number (the DDS\#) with which you could find the actual book in the clustered index.
>
> Of course, nothing would stop the librarian from photocopying all the cards and sorting them in a different order in a separate card catalog. (Typically there were at least two such catalogs: one sorted by author name, and one by title.) In principle, you could have as many of these "non-clustered" indexes as you want.
