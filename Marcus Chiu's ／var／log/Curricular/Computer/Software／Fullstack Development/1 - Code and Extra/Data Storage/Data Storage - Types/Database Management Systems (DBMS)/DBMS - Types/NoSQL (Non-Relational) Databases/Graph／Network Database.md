###### Graph/Network Database
````excerpt
- is a type of [[NoSQL (Non-Relational) Databases]] that uses [[Graph Structures & Algorithms|graph structures]] for queries with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data
````
^excerpt

Graph databases are purpose-built to store and navigate relationships. Relationships are first-class citizens in graph databases, and most of the value of graph databases is derived from these relationships. Graph databases use nodes to store data entities, and edges to store relationships between entities

Real-time big graphs enable real-time large graph analysis with both 100M+ vertex or edge traversals/sec/server and 100K+ updates/sec/server. To handle big and growing datasets, real-time big graph databases are designed to scale up and scale out well.",

The main disadvantage is that the performance cannot match a dedicated and optimized database management system.",
