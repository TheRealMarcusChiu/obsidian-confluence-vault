### Launching on a Cluster

The Spark [cluster mode overview](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.0-preview2/cluster-overview.html) explains the key concepts in running on a cluster. Spark can run both by itself, or over several existing cluster managers. It currently provides several options for deployment:
- [Standalone Deploy Mode](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.0-preview2/spark-standalone.html): simplest way to deploy Spark on a private cluster
- [Apache Mesos](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.0-preview2/running-on-mesos.html)
- [Hadoop YARN](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.0-preview2/running-on-yarn.html)
- [Kubernetes](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.0-preview2/running-on-kubernetes.html)
