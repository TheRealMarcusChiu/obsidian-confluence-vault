[[Apache Hadoop]] and [[Apache Spark]] are both big data frameworks, but they differ in their approach to processing data.
- Hadoop, with its [[Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)|HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)]] and [[MapReduce (MR)|MapReduce]] framework, is primarily designed for batch processing of large datasets stored on disk.
- Spark, on the other hand, is built for speed and real-time processing, leveraging in-memory computations and a fault-tolerant data structure called [[Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD)|Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)]].

Here's a more detailed comparison:

      },
      "- <strong>Hadoop</strong> - Uses MapReduce, a batch processing framework that reads and writes data to disk at each stage.\n- <strong>Spark</strong> - processes data in memory, enabling faster execution, particularly for iterative algorithms like those used in machine learning."

      "- <strong>Hadoop</strong> - More cost-effective due to its ability to leverage disk storage and less expensive hardware\n- <strong>Spark</strong> - Higher cost due to its reliance on in-memory computations, requiring more RAM."

      },
      "- <strong>Hadoop</strong> - Easily scalable by adding more nodes and disks, as it relies on HDFS for storage\n- <strong>Spark</strong> - While scalable, it requires more RAM for in-memory processing and can be more challenging to scale as cluster size increases"
    ],
    [
      {
        "content": "Security",

      "- <strong>Hadoop</strong> - Has robust security features, including authentication, access control, and encryption\n- <strong>Spark</strong> - Provides basic security features and relies on the underlying Hadoop cluster for more comprehensive security"

      },
      "- <strong>Hadoop</strong> - Historically used Apache Mahout for machine learning, which has limitations for iterative algorithms\n- <strong>Spark</strong> - Has a built-in machine learning library called [[Spark MLlib|MLlib]], which is well-suited for iterative algorithms and real-time processing"
    ],
    [
      {
        "content": "Use Cases",
        "header": true,
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      },
      "- <strong>Hadoop</strong> - Ideal for batch processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks, and [[Data Warehouse - Data Lake - Lakeshore Data Mart／Warehouse - Data Mesh|data warehousing]]\n- Spark - Well-suited for real-time analytics, streaming data processing, machine learning, and interactive data exploration"
    ]
  ]
}
```

In essence:
- Choose Hadoop for batch processing, large-scale data storage, and when cost is a primary concern.
- Choose Spark for real-time analytics, machine learning, and when speed and iterative computations are essential.
