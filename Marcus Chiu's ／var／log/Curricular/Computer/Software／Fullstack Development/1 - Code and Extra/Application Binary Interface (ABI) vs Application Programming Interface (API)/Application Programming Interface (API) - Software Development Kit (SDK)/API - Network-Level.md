<strong>[[API - Network-Level|Network-Level API]]</strong> (synonymous to [[Computer Network／Networking Layers - Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model|OSI]]'s [[7 - Application Layer|application-layer protocols]]) refers to any network protocol used to exchange data between participating parties. These are used to build Application-Level APIs and usually follows an [[API Design Patterns (API-DP)|API Design Pattern]]

# Network-Level API Comparisons
- [WebSockets vs HTTP](https://www.pubnub.com/blog/2015-01-05-websockets-vs-rest-api-understanding-the-difference/)
	- both run on top of TCP, WebSockets use HTTP for initial connection setup
	- both allows persistent connections (HTTP Keep Alive)
	- however, only WebSockets supports unsolicited communication from server to client (after HTTP initialize)
- WebSockets vs RSocket
	- Websockets do not provide application-level backpressure, only TCP-based byte-level backpressure
	- Websockets also only provide framing they do not provide application semantics. It is up to the developer to build out an application protocol for interacting with the websocket
	- RSocket provides framing, application semantics, application-level backpressure, and it is not tied to a specific transport
- [RSocket vs gRPC](https://medium.com/netifi/differences-between-grpc-and-rsocket-e736c954e60)
	- RSocket works in a web browser via Websockets, while gRPC requires additional code to be generated and deployed in order to work in browser
	- RSocket has application level flow control while gRPC relies on HTTP/2 byte-based flow control
