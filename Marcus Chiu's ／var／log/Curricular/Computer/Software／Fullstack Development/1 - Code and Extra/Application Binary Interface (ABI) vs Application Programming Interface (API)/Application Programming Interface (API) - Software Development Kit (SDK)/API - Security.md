### API Credential Types

        "content": "API Credential Type",
        "header": true,
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"

      "<strong>Basic Access Authentication</strong>",
      "is a method in which the user agent provides a user name and password when making a specific request",
      "<strong>[[HTTP - Headers - WWW-Authenticate & Authorization|HTTP Authorization Header]]:</strong>\n- <strong>Basic Scheme</strong> - credentials encoded in [[Base64 Notation]] (is not [[Encryption|encryption]])\n- <strong>Digest Scheme</strong> - credentials encrypted with a [[Cryptographic Hash Function - Message Digest Function|cryptographic hash function]]"
    ],
    [
      "<strong>[[Authentication／Authorization／Delegation - Token-Based|Token-Based Authentication]]</strong>",
      "is a method that allow users to enter their username and password in order to obtain a token which allows them to make a specific request - without using their username and password. Once their token has been obtained, the user can offer the token - which offers access to a specific resource for a time period - to the remote site",
      "<strong><strong>[[HTTP - Headers - WWW-Authenticate & Authorization|HTTP Authorization Header]]:</strong></strong>\n- <strong>Bearer Scheme</strong> - credentials in a form of a token"
    ]
  ],
  "tableStyle": "width: 100.0%;"
}
```

in practice Credentials show up in all sorts of places:
- HTTP Authorization Header
- HTTP Custom Header
- HTTP Request Body
- HTTP Query String
