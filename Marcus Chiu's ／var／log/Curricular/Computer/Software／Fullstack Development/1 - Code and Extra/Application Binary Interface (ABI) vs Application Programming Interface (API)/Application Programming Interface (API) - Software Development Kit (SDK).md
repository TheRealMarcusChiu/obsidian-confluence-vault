API is always SDK, SDK is NOT always API
- <strong>Application Programming Interface (API)</strong> is a set of operations that a developer can use to access the backend of a server. You use the API by calling it from your device to the Cloud (a bunch of servers connected to the Internet) running the service
	- Networked API -
	- Non-Networked API -
- <strong>Software Development Kit (SDK)</strong> is a group of tools, including pieces of code, that gets embedded into a service. The SDK contains APIs and so, it calls on the API when necessary to execute tasks. The result is the developer calls the SDK locally and the SDK calls the API remotely
