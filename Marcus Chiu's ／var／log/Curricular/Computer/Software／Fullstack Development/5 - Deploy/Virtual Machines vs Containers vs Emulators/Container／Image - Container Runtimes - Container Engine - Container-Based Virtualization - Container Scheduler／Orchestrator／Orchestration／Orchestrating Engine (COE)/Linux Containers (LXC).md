###### Linux Container (LXC) (lex-see)
````excerpt
- is a program which creates and administers “[[Container／Image - Container Runtimes - Container Engine - Container-Based Virtualization - Container Scheduler／Orchestrator／Orchestration／Orchestrating Engine (COE)|containers]]” on a local system
- is a system-level container virtualization method for running multiple isolated Linux systems on a control host using a single [[Linux Kernel|Linux kernel]]
- is very much like a [[Virtual Machines (VM) - Hypervisors ／ Virtualizer ／ Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) (Type-1 Bare Metal - Type-2 Hosted)|virtual machine]], but significantly lighter weight since it is sharing the host kernel with the LXC host. It does not require the disk space or other resources as full VMs
- is a subset of [[LXD]]
