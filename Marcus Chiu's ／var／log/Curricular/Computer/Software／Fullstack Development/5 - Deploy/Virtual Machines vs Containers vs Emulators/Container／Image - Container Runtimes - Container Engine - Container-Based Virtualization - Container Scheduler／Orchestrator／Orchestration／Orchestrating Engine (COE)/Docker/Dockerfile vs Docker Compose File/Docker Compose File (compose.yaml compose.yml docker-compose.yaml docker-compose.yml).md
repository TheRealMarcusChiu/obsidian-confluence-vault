Compose file is
- compose.yaml (preferred) or compose.yml in working directory
- docker-compose.yaml and docker-compose.yml is also supported for backward compatibility

If both files exist, Compose implementations MUST prefer canonical compose.yaml one
# Subpages
```dataview
LIST
FROM ""
WHERE file.folder = this.file.folder + "/" + this.file.name
```
