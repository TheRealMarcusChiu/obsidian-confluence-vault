###### Konnectivity Service
````excerpt
- replaces SSH tunnels for communication between [[Kubernetes Control Plane Component|control plane]] and [[Kubernetes Worker Node Component|worker nodes]]
- provides TCP level proxy for the control plane to cluster communication
- consists of two parts:
	- the Konnectivity server in the control plane network
	- the Konnectivity agents in the nodes network
- The Konnectivity agents initiate connections to the Konnectivity server and maintain the network connections
- After enabling the Konnectivity service, all control plane to nodes traffic goes through these connections
