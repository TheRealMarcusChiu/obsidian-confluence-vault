Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

  export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

  kubeadm join k8s-control.pve1.lan:6443 --token vo8v1g.x0mo3351gfnduc9t \
	--discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:ed15b7fca732839fd595a8927234520cb9b70f35d58687434a4cbb07b30a9473 \
	--control-plane --certificate-key 9ed5ccf5932d2f28b5170b210be69935a54088d149b94c222ab5ee2bee27d3bc

Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
"kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join k8s-control.pve1.lan:6443 --token vo8v1g.x0mo3351gfnduc9t \
	--discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:ed15b7fca732839fd595a8927234520cb9b70f35d58687434a4cbb07b30a9473
```
# If Root User

Execute the following (if not see output above):
```
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
```
