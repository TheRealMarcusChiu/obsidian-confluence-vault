###### Kubernetes Control Plane Component
````excerpt
- Manage the overall state of the cluster:
	- <strong>[[Kubernetes API Server (kube-apiserver)|kube-apiserver]]</strong> - the core component server that exposes the Kubernetes HTTP API
	- <strong>[[Etcd|etcd]]</strong> - consistent and highly-available key value store for all API server data
	- <strong>[[Kubernetes Scheduler (kube-scheduler)|kube-scheduler]]</strong> - Looks for Pods not yet bound to a node, and assigns each Pod to a suitable node
	- <strong>[[Kubernetes Controller Manager (kube-controller-manager)|kube-controller-manager]]</strong> - runs controllers to implement Kubernetes API behavior
	- <strong>cloud-controller-manager</strong> (optional) - integrates with underlying cloud provider(s)

# Control Plane - Deployment Options

The control plane components can be deployed in several ways:
