# Problem
![[Proxmox - TASK ERROR： Device ／dev／dri／card0 does not exist/proxmox-error.png|900]]
# Solution
```
ssh into proxmox server
ls /dev/dri
# to see that no card0 exist and that card1 exists

# create a permanent symlink
vim /etc/udev/rules.d/99-my-gpu.rules

# add the following into that file
SUBSYSTEM=="drm", KERNEL=="card1", SYMLINK+="dri/card0"
# this line symlinks card0 to the existing card1
```
