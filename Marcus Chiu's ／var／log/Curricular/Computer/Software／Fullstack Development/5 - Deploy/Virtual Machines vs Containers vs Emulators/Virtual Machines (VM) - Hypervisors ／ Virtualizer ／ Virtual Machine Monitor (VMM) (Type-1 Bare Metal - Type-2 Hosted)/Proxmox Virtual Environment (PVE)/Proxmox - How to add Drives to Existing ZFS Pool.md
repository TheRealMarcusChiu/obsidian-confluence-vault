- [[ZFS - How to Add New Drives into Existing ZPool in Mirror Mode]]

As of Fall 2025, Proxmox UI does not currently support adding additional drives to an existing ZFS pool as you can see below.

![[Proxmox - How to add Drives to Existing ZFS Pool/1.png|900]]

Everything has to be done through command line
```
zpool status
ls -lsah /dev/disk/by-id/
zpool add $ZFS_POOL_NAME_HERE mirror $DISK_NAME_1 $DISK_NAME_2
zpool add rpool mirror ata-QEMU_HARDDISK_QM00007 ata-QEMU_HARDDISK_QM00009
zpool status
```

Navigate back to Proxmox UI and verify the drives has been added.
