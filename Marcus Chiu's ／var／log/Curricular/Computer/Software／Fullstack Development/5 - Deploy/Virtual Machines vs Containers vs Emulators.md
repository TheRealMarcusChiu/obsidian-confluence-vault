### Virtual Machines vs Containers
- [[Virtual Machines (VM) - Hypervisors ／ Virtualizer ／ Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) (Type-1 Bare Metal - Type-2 Hosted)|Virtual Machines]]
	- runs a full-blown guest OS with <em>virtual</em> access to host resources through a hypervisor
	- bins/libs (included with guest OS and installed additionally for application(s)) are independent between VMs
	- in general, VMs incur a lot of overhead beyond what is being consumed by your application logic
- [[Container／Image - Container Runtimes - Container Engine - Container-Based Virtualization - Container Scheduler／Orchestrator／Orchestration／Orchestrating Engine (COE)|Containers]]
	- runs <em>natively</em> on OS and shares the kernel of the host machine with other containers
	- bins/libs are shared between containers through the Container Engine
	- it runs a discrete process, taking no more memory than any other executable, making it lightweight
- [[Emulators／Mediator|Emulators/Mediator]]
	- TODO
