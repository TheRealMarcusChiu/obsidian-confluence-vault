<strong>Test Double</strong> is the generic term for any kind of pretend object used in place of a real object for testing purposes

```merge-table
{
  "rows": [
    [
      {
        "content": "Test Double Type",
        "header": true,
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      },
      {

      {
        "content": "Dummy",
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      },
      "- dummy objects are passed around but never actually used\n- usually, they are just used to fill parameter lists."
    ],

      {
        "content": "Fake",
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      },
      "- fake objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut that makes them not suitable for production\n- behaves exactly the same as their real counterparts\n- an in-memory/embedded database is a fake of a real database"

        "content": "Stub",
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      },
      "- stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what's programmed in for the test\n- can be used for state verification"

        "content": "Spy",
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      },

      {

        "bg": "#F4F5F7"

# Stub vs Mock - Lifecycle

Test lifecycle with stubs:
1. Setup - prepare the object that is being tested and its stubs collaborators
2. Exercise - test the functionality
3. Verify state - use asserts to check the object's state
4. Teardown - clean up resources

Test lifecycle with mocks:
1. Setup data - prepare the object that is being tested
2. <strong>Setup expectations</strong> - prepare expectations in mock that is being used by the primary object
3. Exercise - test the functionality
4. <strong>Verify expectations</strong> - verify those correct methods have been invoked in mock
5. Verify state - use asserts to check the object's state
6. Teardown - clean up resources
