###### Front-End Microservice (FEM) - Modular Frontend - Micro Frontend
- an architectural style where independently deliverable frontend applications are composed into a greater whole
- combining multiple frameworks (e.g. [[Angular]], [[React - React.js - ReactJS|React]], [[Vue - Vue.js - VueJS|Vue.js]], etc) into a Single Page Application (SPA)

# FEM - Pros
- <strong>smaller decoupled cohesive codebases</strong> - by drawing thicker lines around the bounded contexts of the application, we make it harder for such accidental coupling to arise
- <strong>incremental independent upgrades</strong> -
- <strong>independent deployment</strong> -

# FEM - Cons
- can lead to duplication of dependencies, increasing the number of bytes our users must download
- the dramatic increase in team autonomy can cause fragmentation in the way your teams work
