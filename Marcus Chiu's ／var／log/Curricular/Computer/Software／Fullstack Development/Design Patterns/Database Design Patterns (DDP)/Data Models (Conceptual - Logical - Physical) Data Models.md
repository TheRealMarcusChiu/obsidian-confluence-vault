###### Data Model
- is defined as an abstract model that organizes data description, data semantics, and consistency constraints of data
- emphasizes what data is needed and how it should be organized instead of what operations will be performed on data
- is like an architect's building plan, which helps to build conceptual models and set a relationship between data items
