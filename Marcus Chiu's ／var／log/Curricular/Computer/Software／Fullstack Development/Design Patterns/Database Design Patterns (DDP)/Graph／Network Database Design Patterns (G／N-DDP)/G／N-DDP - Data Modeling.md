# Graph/Network Building Blocks
- <strong>nodes</strong> - are entities
- <strong>relationships/edges</strong> - connect nodes (defines structure)

adding details to nodes and relationships:
- properties - attributes and metadata to both nodes and relationships
- labels - used for grouping nodes and relationships

# Use Relationships When...

you need to specify either:
- weight, strength, or other quality of the relationship:
	- friendship strength
	- proficiency skill
- attribute value comprises a complex value type
	- address (first line, second line, zip code, etc)
- attribute values are interconnected
	- taxonomy of skills

# Use Properties When

There is no need to qualify the relationship AND attribute value is a simple value type
# Reasons for Intermediate Nodes
- connect more than 2 nodes in a single context
	- e.g. Ian bought a book in Barnes and Noble
- n-ary relationships
	- e.g. Sure invited Sarah, Bob and Charlie to her party
- relate something to a relationship
