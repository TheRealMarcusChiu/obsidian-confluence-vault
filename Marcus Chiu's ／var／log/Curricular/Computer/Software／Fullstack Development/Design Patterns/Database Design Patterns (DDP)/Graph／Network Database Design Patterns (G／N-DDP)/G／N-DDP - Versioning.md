###### Graph/Network Database Design Patterns (G/N-DDP) - Versioning
- versioning graph/network data
- the main idea is to separate structure from state (note: structure is tied to identity)

# Versioning Graph Data

a graph database contains 2 types of building blocks:
- nodes/entities
- edges/relationships

thus, versioning graph data essentially means versioning these 2 types of data
### 1 - Versioning Nodes

split the node data into 2 disjoint datasets:
- node identity
- node state

### 2 - Versioning Edges

split the relationship data into 2 disjoint datasets:
- edge identity - starting-node-id or edge-id
- edge state - may include starting-node-id, ending-node-id, and any other state properties of the relationship
