# API Design Pattern Comparisons
- [REST vs GraphQL](https://blog.apollographql.com/graphql-vs-rest-5d425123e34b)
	- [Caching](https://philsturgeon.uk/api/2017/01/26/graphql-vs-rest-caching/) - you can’t "network" cache GraphQL results as easily as you can with REST results. GraphQL relies on "application" caching, which is a little more complicated
- [RPC vs REST - over HTTP](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/09/understanding-rest-and-rpc-for-http-apis/)
	- If an API is mostly actions, maybe it should be RPC
	- If an API is mostly CRUD, maybe it should be REST
