# Event-Bus
- apps using a shared (common) set of interfaces
- apps have a set of agreed-upon message schemas
- when an app wants to send a message it passes it to the message bus, which is responsible for delivering the message to all the other apps listening for messages on the bus’ shared infrastructure

# Message Broker
- fully decouples apps from one another
- apps have no awareness of either the number or destination / location of consuming apps
