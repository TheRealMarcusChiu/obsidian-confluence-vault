###### Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- states that software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification

# Ways to Implement OCP

> [!expand-ui]- Interface Example
> Interfaces are one way to follow OCP
> # Non-Compliant Way
> ```
> public interface CalculatorOperation {}
>
> public class Addition implements CalculatorOperation {
>     private double left;
>     private double right;
>     private double result = 0.0;
>
>     public Addition(double left, double right) {
>         this.left = left;
>         this.right = right;
>     }
>
>     // getters and setters
> }
>
> public class Subtraction implements CalculatorOperation {
>     private double left;
>     private double right;
>     private double result = 0.0;
>
>     public Subtraction(double left, double right) {
>         this.left = left;
>         this.right = right;
>     }
>
>     // getters and setters
> }
>
> public class Calculator {
>     public void calculate(CalculatorOperation operation) {
>         if (operation instanceof Addition) {
>             Addition addition = (Addition) operation;
>             addition.setResult(addition.getLeft() + addition.getRight());
>         } else if (operation instanceof Subtraction) {
>             Subtraction subtraction = (Subtraction) operation;
>             subtraction.setResult(subtraction.getLeft() - subtraction.getRight());
>         }
>     }
> }
> ```
>
> When a new requirement of adding multiplication or divide functionality comes in, we've no way besides changing the calculate method of the Calculator class
> # Compliant Way

>     void perform();

> public class Addition implements CalculatorOperation {
