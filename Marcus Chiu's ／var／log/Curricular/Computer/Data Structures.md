###### Data Structure
````excerpt
- is a data organization, management, and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data
- a data structure is:
	- a collection of [[Data／Variable Types (Statistics／Programming)|data values]]
	- the relationships between the data values
	- the functions or operations that can be applied to the data structure itself (i.e. it is an [[Algebraic Structures|algebraic structure]] of [[Data／Variable Types (Statistics／Programming)|data]])

# Data Structures - Functional vs Implementational
- <strong>functional structure</strong> - defines the function of a structure (higher level)
- <strong>implementational structure</strong> - defines how a structure is put together (lower level)

Given a functional structure, there can be multiple implementational structures. For example:
- function structure - a data structure that represents node i and its adjacent nodes, for all nodes i
- implementational structure - adjacency matrix or adjacency list

# Subpages
```dataview
LIST
FROM ""
WHERE file.folder = this.file.folder + "/" + this.file.name
```

- Arrays
	- static vs dynamic
- Linked List
	- Singly Linked List
	- Doubly Linked List
- Stack - Last-In First-Out
- Queue - First-In First-Out
- Deque - both sides
