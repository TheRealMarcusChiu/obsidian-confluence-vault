<strong>Distributed Consensus Agreement Problem (CAP)</strong> is a type of [[Distributed - Agreement Problems|Distributed Agreement Problem]]

In CAP, all processes propose a value. Specifically, process P<sub>i</sub>proposes value v<sub>i</sub> by executing Cons\_propose(v<sub>i</sub>) and decides on a value u<sub>i</sub>by calling Cons\_decide().

A protocol that solves the CAP must satisfy the following properties:
- TERMINATION - all non-faulty processes eventually decide
- AGREEMENT - all non-faulty processes decide on the same value
- VALIDITY -  if all non-faulty processes propose the same value, then all of them decide on the value proposed
