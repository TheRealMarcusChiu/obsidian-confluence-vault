this algorithm:
- calculates the local and channel state between multiple communicating processes
- assumes FIFO channels between communicating processes

# <strong>Pseudocode</strong>
- on recording local state, a process sends a MARKER MESSAGE to all outgoing neighbors
- on sending MARKER MESSAGE to all outgoing neighbors, start monitoring all incoming channels
- on receiving MARKER MESSAGE, record local state if not done so already
- on receiving all MARKER MESSAGES from incoming channels, stop monitoring incoming channels

### Example
```
Nodes and Channels

P1 -------- P2 -------- P3
```
```
Example Chandy & Lamport Execution

           \        \    /mm          /am-2

                  /am-3    \    /mm
P3 --------------.----------.RS.---------------------->

am - app message
mm - marker message
RS - record local state
== - monitoring channels
```

in the example execution depicted above, am-3 is considered in transit

G = \[a b d\]
V(a) = \[1 0 0\]
V(b) = \[1 1 0\]
V(d) = \[1 2 2\] 
therefore V(d) is the max

G = \[a b c\]
V(a) = \[1 0 0\]
V(b) = \[1 1 0\]
V(c) = \[0 0 1\] 
therefore there is no max

```

when P<sub>i</sub> records local-state it immediately sends marker message to neighboring processes.
when marker message is received by P<sub>j</sub>, by rule 2, it should either:
- record its local state if it hasn't
- do nothing because it already has recorded its local state

therefore we have reached a contradiction that P<sub>j</sub> cannot be able to record its local state sometime after it received a marker message
# <strong>Complexity - Assuming</strong><strong> Bi-Directional Links</strong>

given:
- n = \# of nodes
- e = \# of bi-directional edges
- d = diameter of graph

complexity
- message complexity - O(e) - maximum O(n(n-1))
- time complexity - O(d) more accurately O(d+1) - minimum O(1) & maximum O(n)
