# <strong>Example Banking System</strong>

local states:

global states:
- \<u,x\>
- \<v,y\>
- \<v,x\>
- \<u,y\>

system state = process state + network/channel state

## <strong>Extend Happens-Before (→)  Relation</strong>
- only compares between:
	- state and state
	- event and event
- does not compare between: event and state

- let s and t be local states of processes Pi and Pj respectively
	- we say that s → t <strong>if</strong> there exists events e and f such that all of the following holds:
		- Pi executes e after reaching s
		- Pj executes f before reaching t
		- (e = f) or (e → f)
	- we say s and t are concurrent (syntactically represented as "s||t") <strong>if </strong>both:
		- s ⥇ t
		- t ⥇ s

## <strong>Global Snapshot/State-Capture Properties</strong>
- G is a set of local states (one from each process)
- G\[i\] is the local state of process Pi
- there can be multiple Gs in a given domain

###### Consistent Global State/Snapshot Protocol
- returns a global state/snapshot that is guaranteed to be consistent

###### Strongly-Consistent Snapshot Protocol
- returns a global state that is guaranteed to be STRONGLY consistent
- strongly consistent - no intransit messages
