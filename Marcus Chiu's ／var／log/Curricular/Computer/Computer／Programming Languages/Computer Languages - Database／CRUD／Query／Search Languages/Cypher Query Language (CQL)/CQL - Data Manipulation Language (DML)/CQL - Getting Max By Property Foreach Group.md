# Problem 1 - Statement

Given the graph below, construct a query to return the encircled sub-graph:
- return Application with property sealId=?
- return all ApplicationModules owned by Application
- return all APIs provided for each ApplicationModule
- <strong>return Request with max version property for each API</strong>

# Problem 2 - Statement

Given the graph below, construct a query to return the encircled sub-graph:
- return Application with property sealId=?
- return all ApplicationModules owned by Application
- return all APIs provided for each ApplicationModule <strong>(return only the relationship with highest version property) <font style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">← ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINT</font></strong>
- return Request with max version property for each API
