# Bad Join Order
```sql
SELECT
  o.order_id,
  s.country_of_manufacture
FROM
  orders o						            -- 73595 rows
  INNER JOIN order_lines l			        -- 231412 rows
    ON o.order_id = l.order_id			    -- 231412 rows after join
  INNER JOIN stock_items s		            -- 227 rows
    ON l.stock_item_id = s.stock_item_id	-- 1036 rows after join 
	AND s.country_of_manufacture = 'USA'	-- 8 rows for USA
```

we want to join both stock\_items and order\_lines first, then orders table
# Query Optimizer Automatically Does This For Us
- table a has 4 rows
- table b has 6 rows
- table c has 0 rows
```sql
SELECT * FROM a INNER JOIN b ON a.id = b.a_id INNER JOIN c ON b.a_id = c.test;
SELECT * FROM a INNER JOIN c ON a.id = c.test INNER JOIN b ON b.a_id = c.test;
SELECT * FROM c INNER JOIN a ON a.id = c.test INNER JOIN b ON b.a_id = c.test;
```

all 3 SELECT statements results in the SAME execution plan

the Query Optimizer uses table [[Statistics|statistics]] to quickly determine to best join order

there are tricks to enforce join order
