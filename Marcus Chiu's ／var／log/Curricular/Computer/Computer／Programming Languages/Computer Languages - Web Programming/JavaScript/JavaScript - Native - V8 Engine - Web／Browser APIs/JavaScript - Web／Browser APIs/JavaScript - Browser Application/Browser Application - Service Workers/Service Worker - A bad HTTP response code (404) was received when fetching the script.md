![[Service Worker - A bad HTTP response code (404) was received when fetching the script/service-worker-error.png|400]]

This happens when a previous app on the same url did utilize a [[Browser Application - Service Workers|service worker]]
### The Fix

Chrome → devtools → Application → Clear Storage → Check Unregister Service Worker → then click Clear Site Data
