<strong>LLVM</strong>
- is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies
- has little to do with traditional [[Virtual Machines (VM) - Hypervisors ／ Virtualizer ／ Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) (Type-1 Bare Metal - Type-2 Hosted)|virtual machines]]

# LLVM - Compilation Stages

In the LLVM the compilation takes three stages

![[Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM)/llvm_compiler_pipeline.png|600]]

The stages are:
- The <strong>frontend</strong>, parsing the original language and spits out IR code
- The <strong>optimizer</strong>, mangling one IR into optimized equivalent IR. This stage does all the usual optimizations like constant propagation, dead code removal, and so on
- The <strong>backend</strong>, taking IR and producing machine code optimized for a specific CPU

# LLVM - Middle-end Compiler

# LLVM - Backend Compiler

The backend supports compiling IR into many different [[Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)|Instruction Set Architectures]]
