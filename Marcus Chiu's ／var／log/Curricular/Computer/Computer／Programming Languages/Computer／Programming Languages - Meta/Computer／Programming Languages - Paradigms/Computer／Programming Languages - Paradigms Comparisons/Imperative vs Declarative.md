- <strong>Declarative Programming</strong> is a [[Computer／Programming Languages - Paradigms|programming paradigm]] that focuses on what to execute, and defines program logic, but not detailed control flow
- <strong>[[Imperative Programming Paradigm|Imperative Programming]]</strong> - is a [[Computer／Programming Languages - Paradigms|programming paradigm]] that focuses on how to execute, and defines control flow as statements that change a program state

# Declarative vs Imperative - Which is Better?

```merge-table
{
  "rows": [
    [
      {
        "content": "Parallel Computing",
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      },
      "- declarative programming allows for AUTOMATIC parallel computing as they only specify a pattern of results, not the algorithm used to determine the results (e.g. [[Structured Query Language (SQL)|SQL]])\n- imperative programming requires the developer to update the algorithm to utilize parallel computing"
