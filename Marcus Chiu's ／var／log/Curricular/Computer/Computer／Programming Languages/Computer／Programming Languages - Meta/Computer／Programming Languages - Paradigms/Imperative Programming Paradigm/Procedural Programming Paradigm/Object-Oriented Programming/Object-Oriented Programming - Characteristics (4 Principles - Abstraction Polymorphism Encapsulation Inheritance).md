# Object-Oriented Programming - Additional Principles
1. All pre-defined types must be objects
2. All user-defined types must be objects
3. All operations on objects must be done through methods

# Object-Oriented Programming - Essentials & Non-Essentials (according to Alan Kay)

Essentials:
- Encapsulation
- Message passing
- Dynamic binding (the ability for the program to evolve/adapt at runtime)

Non-Essentials:
- Classes
- Class inheritance
- Special treatment for objects/functions/data
- The new keyword
- Polymorphism
- Static types
- Recognizing a class as a “type”
