Spring Data JDBC knows a class is an aggregate root when it contains a repository for that class. And because the rules of the aggregate entities are connected through object references (i.e. one-to-one are object reference, and one-to-many is a collection of objects) Spring Data JDBC also knows what the aggregates are and can transfer data to the database as aggregates."
