###### Transaction Isolation Level
- determines how locks are set, which can range from not supporting transactions at all to supporting transactions that enforce very strict access rules

# Transaction - Read Anomalies
- A <strong><em>dirty read</em></strong> occurs when accessing an updated value that has not been committed because it is possible for that value to be rolled back to its previous value. If you read a value that is later rolled back, you will have read an invalid value
- A <strong><em>non-repeatable read</em></strong> occurs when transaction A retrieves a row, transaction B subsequently updates the row, and transaction A later retrieves the same row again. Transaction A retrieves the same row twice but sees different data.
- A <strong><em>phantom read</em></strong> occurs when transaction A retrieves a set of rows satisfying a given condition, transaction B subsequently inserts or updates a row such that the row now meets the condition in transaction A, and transaction A later repeats the conditional retrieval. Transaction A now sees an additional row. This row is referred to as a phantom
- A <em><strong>serialization anomaly</strong></em> The result of successfully committing a group of transactions is inconsistent with all possible orderings of running those transactions one at a time

# Transaction - Isolation Levels ()

The interface <code><font style="color: rgb(122,134,154);">java.sql.Connection</font></code> includes five values that represent the transaction isolation levels you can use in [[Java - Spring - Spring JDBC|JDBC]]:
