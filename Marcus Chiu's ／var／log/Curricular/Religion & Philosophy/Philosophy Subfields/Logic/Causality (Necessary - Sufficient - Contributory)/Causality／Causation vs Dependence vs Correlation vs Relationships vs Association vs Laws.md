However, the word \"relation\" in the mathematical sense is more general and many people often use it more broadly without qualifying it. For example, imagine points scattered about a set of concentric ring shapes. I probably wouldn't say that the variables were related (at least not without adding something to say that they weren't functionally related) but some people would happily do so"

For example, imagine two variables where all the points tend to lay within small discs of probability (and not outside them), but where these discs are scattered about in a way that looks random. Then I would usually avoid the term \"relationship\" (qualified or not) and stick to associated or dependent"

# Causality vs Dependence
- causality ≠ dependence

If 𝑋 and 𝑌 are in <strong>𝑽</strong> and are [[Probability Dependence|probabilistically dependent]], then either:
- 𝑋 causes 𝑌
- 𝑌 causes 𝑋
- 𝑋 and 𝑌 are both effects of some common cause 𝑍 in <strong>𝑽</strong>
