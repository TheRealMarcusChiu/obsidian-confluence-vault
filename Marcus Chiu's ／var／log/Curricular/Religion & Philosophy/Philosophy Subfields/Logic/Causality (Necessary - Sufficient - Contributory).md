###### Causality
````excerpt
- causality is efficacy, by which one process or state, a cause, contributes to the production of another process or state, an effect, where the cause is partly responsible for the effect, and the effect is partly dependent on the cause
- "we should not confuse relationships & laws with causes" \~ [VSauce](https://youtu.be/_WHRWLnVm_M?t=395)

# Causality Types
- <strong>Deterministic Causality</strong> - if 𝐴 causes 𝐵, then 𝐴 must always be followed by 𝐵 ([[Deterministic CPD]])
- <strong>Non-Deterministic Causality</strong> - if 𝐴 causes 𝐵, then 𝐴 is followed by 𝐵 with some [[Probability|probability]] ([[Conditional Probability Distribution (CPD)|Conditional Probability Distribution]])
